We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some Riesling impersonators, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 

2019 Lake George Winery | Lake George | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Citrus, flowers and a wiff of honey on the nose, giving way to a light palate with good but not overbearing acidity. A beautifully balanced wine, perfect ot start with. 
2019 Sapling Yard Bungendore  | Bungendore | 65 bottle 
Lush floral nose followed by racy acidity and effervescence on the front palate. Good balance and tight minerality. Good long finish. Winemaker Carla Rodeghiero is also vigneron, picker and delivery driver – talk about a one-woman show!
2018 Clonakilla | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle 
Power and precision, like all Clonakilla wines. Buckets of lime, super tight acidity and it just keeps going and going…

2019 Nick O’Leary White Rocks  | Lake George | 85 bottle
This will be spoken about in revered tones in years to come; a brilliant wine showing the intensity and balance of great Canberra Rieslings. Taken from the Lake George Winery site on the edge of Lake George. 

2011 Eden Road | Murrumbateman | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Rich oily nose to the fore, bright acid and lime cordial on the front palate, dry texture. Great wine, got the structure and life of fruit to live another 5 years. 

2019 Gallagher | Jeir | 65 bottle 
Bright lemon curd, mandarin, honey, minerality. Superbly balanced, great finish. Clapping emoji.

2019 Helm Classic  | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle | 20 glass
Classic for a reason. Crisp lime and lemon juice aromas, Canberra minerality. Dry as could be. Perfect young, definitely ageable, good value. 

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2015 Lark Hill Estate  back-vintage | Bungendore | 120 bottle 
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. A veritable bevvy of citrus on the palate. Great length. Wildly enjoyable. Biodynamic. 

2019 Sholto | Murrumbateman | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Rich floral nose, with a sweetness taken back by clean acidity and tight texture. Orange, pear and mandarin on the palate. Dry finish. Super quirky and different for CBR Riesling and highly enjoyable. 

2019 Four Winds | 65 bottle
An off-dry style; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from an excellent producer. 

2019 Helm Half Dry  | Murrumbateman | 55 bottle | 14 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.


The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 13 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2019 Four Winds Sparkling Riesling | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle | 15 glass
Crisp grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose and on the palate, light and fresh with zingy acidity. Refreshing. Spring in a glass.  

2019 Unico Zelo Sea Foam  Fiano Pet Nat | Riverlands, SA | 60 bottle
Fun funky bubbles from SA. Aromatic and quirky nose, giving way to mouthfilling fizz and ripe citrus and apple flavours. 

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 


Rose 
Pretty, pretty dry, and pretty good with arvo sunshine

2020 Charles Melton Rose of Virginia  | Barossa Valley, SA | 75 bottle 
An Aussie icon. Deep red from a blend of Grenache, Meunier, Shiraz and Cabernet. Grippy tannins balance a slightly richer style rose; citrus and rose petals on the nose, quite perfumed and complex. A serious rose from a seriously good producer. 

2019 Artea | Alpes de Haute Provence, France | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Very pretty nose. Another dry rose, dry flower petals and strawberry/cranberry on the nose. Good long finish. Great little French rose especially for the price. Smashable.
 
2019 Terre a Terre Piccadilly | Adelaide Hills, SA | 70 bottle
Pale pink, pretty nose. What more do you need? A blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% chardonnay grown in the Piccadilly valley subregion of Adelaide Hills. High quality, low production rose.

NV M & J Becker Wines ODP  Rose | Sonoma, USA | 85 bottle
Rich, deep, complex, dry, quirky, confronting. This wine is just an awesome curiosity from Meagan and James Becker, based at Oakvale in the Hunter Valley NSW but also making cracking wines from California. A 60/40 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from multiple vintages for a true ‘field blend’. Inspired stuff.  More amber than rose, don’t expect lolly water. 


Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2019 Grosset Polish Hill  | Clare Valley, SA | 230 magnum 
THE definitive Clare; bone dry, intense citrus and cool slate with a persistent finish. Everything tastes better from a magnum. 

2017 Loosen-Barry Wolta Wolta  | Clare Valley, SA | 180 bottle 
A marriage of ‘royal’ families; the Barry’s from Clare and the Loosen’s from Mosel in Germany. The result? A spectacular example of Clare Riesling. Ripe lime and white nectarine on the nose and palate, fine texture and complex. 

2019 Tappanappa | Eden Valley, SA | 75 bottle 
A quintessential Eden Valley Riesling; bone dry and slightly floral. Citrus and flint on the palate.

2013 Mac Forbes RS16  | Strathbogie Ranges, Vic | 80 bottle 
Fermented in stainless and oak for a textured but clean Riesling. Feels drier than the residual sugar indicator name suggests. Plush start with tropical melon and herbs, finishing with lemon pith and zip. 

2012 Crawford River | Henty, Vic | 185 bottle 
Mainland Australia’s foremost Riesling producer. Supreme ageability from super their site planted in the 1970’s in Henty. Still a youthful green, very delicate with soft floral notes on the nose, apple skins and a hint of white peach on the palate. Acidity has barely softened and this wine still has a good two decades left to live. 

2017 Garagiste Cotier  | Mornington Peninsula, Vic | 75 bottle
Crispy citrus and lemongrass on the nose, a bit of white pepper and spice on the palate backed up by generous fruit. Structure from time in old oak. Super refreshing alternative expression of Riz. 

2018 Frankland Estate Alter Weg  | Frankland River, WA | 80 bottle 
Alter Weg = The Old Way. Barrel ferment dry riesling from Frankland River WA. Tight acidity matched by a nice palate weight. Super food friendly, absolutely delicious and complex Riesling. 

2020 Castle Rock Estate Porongurup  | Frankland River, WA | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Brilliantly bright and lively. Good minerality to it too, but citrus on citrus up on this one. Will age well, but super delicious right now. 

2018 Kate Hill | Derwent & Coal River Valleys, Tas | 80 bottle 
Deliciously spicy light citrus nose, with a full mouthfeel. Supremely well balanced. Tassie wines, so hot right now, Tassie wines…

2018 Stargazer Palisander Vineyard  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 100 bottle 
Steely nose, fresh light citrus, followed by a perfectly balanced palate; not overly dry or sweet. A melody of citrus from lime juice to fresh orange oil. One of the top Tassie Rieslings. 
2019 Printhie Topography  | Orange, NSW | 70 bottle 
Dry and floral, with notes of stonefruit mingled with the citrus splash of aussie Rizla. Plucked from a high altitude site with a northern aspect on the slopes of Mt Canobolas near Orange, NSW. Ripe yet dry. 

International Rieslings
The old world gets pretty worked up about who ‘owns’ Riesling. The Germans, the Austrians, the French. For us: who cares? Just drink the stuff. 

2019 Donnhoff | Nahe, Germany | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Soft and rounded nose, slightly floral, slightly sweet, with tropical fruit and pear on the palate. Light spritz. Great value German off-dry Rizla.

2017 A Christmann Reiterpfad-Hofstuck  GG | Pfalz, Germany | 250 bottle 
Spice, herb and tropical fruit on the nose, then hitting the lemon curd/apple spectrum that’s a bit more familiar to an Aussie palate. Powerful, and an intense long finish. 

2015 Von Schubert Maximin Grunhauser Feinherb | Mosel, Germany | 90 bottle
Restrained nose of tropical fruit salad, light acidity, straight-forward off-dry German Riesling. Uncomplicated and very enjoyable for it.

2017 JJ Prum Graacher Himmelreich Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 230 bottle
Bright and fresh on the nose with the distinct slate and minerality. Slight fizz, intense acidity and honeyed apricot on the palate. How good is the Riesling spectrum of fruits!? 7% ABV makes it almost a driving wine.

2006 Georg Breuer Nonnenberg  GG  | Rheingau, Germany | 200 bottle
Fleshy and generous Riesling and still maturing. Acidity lingers underneath the richer palate. From 80yr-old vines in the middle of the GG site, truly special booze. 

2012 Emmerich Knoll VInothekfullung Loibner  | Wachau, Austria | 210 bottle 
Super rare find. An phenomenal example of age bringing balance to the force. Acidity is delicate but lingers, textured and with generous fruit. Incredible. 

2013 FX Pichler Loibenberg Smaragd  | Wachau, Austria | 160 bottle 
Floral nose with just a slight smokiness to it. From a warmer site and thus a slightly richer Riesling than is typical from Wachau. Lemon and grapefruit on the palate, creamy palate and sustained complex finish. 

2018 Willm Reserve  | Alsace, France | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Beautifully ripe, lush nose with honey and floral notes followed by a well-balanced delivery of fruit and tight acidity. Absolute bargain frenchy. 

2018 Domaine Ostertag Les Jardins | Alsace, France | 260 magnum
White flowers, peach and vine-blossom aromas, followed by a rounded texture and a fine and long acidity. A slight saline character in the finish. Graceful Alsace. Biodynamic producer. 

2018 Domaine Mersiol | Alsace, France | 80 bottle
Pronounced citrus spectrum from lemon to slightly sweeter grapefruit with hints of green apple. Dry and light on the palate, especially for a French. 

2013 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 85 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser makes brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2013 was a cooler year, and this is a ripe Riesling with tropical fruit on the nose, citrus on the palate and a racy acidity.


This is for the G’s 
The imitators of, and close friends to, Riesling

2019 Long Rail Gully Pinot Gris | Murrumbateman, CBR | 60 bottle 
Dry style gris made from 100% estate fruit just north of Murrumbateman. Still keeping in their delicious, dry style with crunchy apple and pear juice and the slightest hint of white pepper on the palate. Delicious. 

2018 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 130 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak and in bottle, a real thinker’s white. Pioneers here in Canberra and recognized as one of the country’s best GV producers.

2020 Vinden Headcase Blanc  | Hunter Valley, NSW | 75 bottle	
So we’re just a wee bit excited about Vinden wines. A gun young winemaker making super interesting booze from a typically ‘conservative’ wine region. The 2020 blanc is anyone’s guess for what’s in it, but its textural, aromatic, dry and just really really good wine. One for the ‘skins’ and ‘natural wines’ crowd for sure. 

2019 Hahndorf Hill Gru  Gruner Veltliner | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Citrus, nectarine and spice on the nose; stonefruit and grapefruit on the palate finished by a long mineral finish with a bit of texture. 

2017 Monte Carbonare Soave  | Suavia, Italy | 85 bottle 
100% Garganega from pure black volcanic soils, and it sure does show. Earthy and textural dry white. Light citrus, apple blossom, nectarine wrapped around tight acidity. Absolute knockout from a cult producer. 


Worthy & worldly Whites

2013 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. You’d have no idea its 7-years old, still as fresh as tomorrow. 

2015 L.A.S Vino CBDB  | Margaret River, WA | 120 bottle 
100% chenin blanc from Margaret River is given the full treatment; wild yeast ferment, French barriques and clay amphora, lees stirring. The result is a textured, layered wine with a tonne of character and integrated fruit from grapefruit to lime and passionfruit. Awesome. 

2018 Nick O’Leary Chardonnay | Tumbarumba, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass
A rich and generous chardy from over the hills by one of our all-time faves. Integrated oak, great mouthfeel and the stonefruit lingers. Big chardy balanced with tight acidity and looooong finish. Really good value. 

2018 Vanguardist Chardonnay | Adelaide Hills, SA | 110 bottle 
Tight and lean style with plenty of citrus and spice; lemon, zest and a hint of anise. Good length from persistent acidity and steely texture. For the Chablis lovers out there. 

A Concise list of Reds
Listed lightest to heaviest, kinda

2020 Ricca Terra Juicy June  | Riverlands, SA | 65 bottle | 16 glass 
SERVED CHILLED. A delicious and bright blend of Negroamaro and Grenache. Luminescent magenta in the glass, crushed black and redcurrants on the nose and palate. When the mercury tips 30 a chilled red is just joyous. 

2016 Boovability Pinot Noir | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle | 16 glass
A Super light red; bright fresh sweet cherry fruit on the front palate, savoury mid palate, good length and a twist of spice on the finish. 

2019 Pooley Cooinda Vale  Pinot Noir | Coal River Valley, TAS | 140 bottle 
Magical pinot. Delicate and juicy at the same time, soft and structured, supple and bright. Red cherry and raspberry, a little savoury and a lengthy finish. Allow 30 minutes in a decanter to kick it in to gear though.

2019 Hahndorf Hill Zsa Zsa  Zweigelt | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle 
How do you describe a wine that can take you from thinking of Pinot to Cabernet in the flash of an eye? You don’t. You just drink it. Enjoy. 

2019 Sholto Rouge Clair  Blend | Gundaroo, CBR | 70 bottle | 17 glass
A quirky wine. Cabernet, Malbec and a splash of Petit Verdot made into a ‘beaujolais’ style light red. We love it, and you will too once you get over the preconception of what those grapes ‘should’ be.

2019 Vanguardist Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 125 bottle
Graceful Grenache from the ‘silver sands’ vineyard at Blewitt Springs. Lots of concentrated red berry character and defined structure. Really good wine.  

2019 Nick Spencer MDR Shiraz Blend | Gundagai, NSW | 80 bottle | 20 glass
Shiraz + Cabernet + Malbec + Tempranillo + Touriga = MDR magic! 
Medium bodied, spice and fruit and character from the lighter grapes, with plenty of grip and body from the heavier varietals. A well balanced, punchy wine showing off the virtues of Gundagai.  

2014 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 250 bottle 
The Ron Burgundy of Canberra reds; it’s kind of a big deal. Great vintage of a super wine; elegant, perfumed, precise, medium-bodied. Simply a great wine and a main reason behind Clonakilla being the flagship of Murrumbateman. 

2018 Te Mata Bullnose  Syrah | Hawke’s Bay, NZ | 140 bottle 
An Iconic Syrah from a single vineyard in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand. Perfumed and spice on the nose, richly blue and red fruits galore, and a fine silky finish. Brilliant. 

2016 Penley Estate 11 Barrels  Shiraz | Coonawarra, SA | 100 bottle
Reward yourself with a cracking Shiraz from Cabernet country. That classic terra rossa character with medium weight red and blue fruit. I’m super chuffed with this wine so I bought the entire ACT allocation. 

2015 Eden Road Cabernet Sauvignon | Gundagai, NSW | 70 bottle 
Just a wow wine. Delicious ripe fruit, blue and black all over. Perfectly balanced and sitting comfortably as a medium-weight Cabernet. 



Dessert style Rieslings 
From beautifully light, to thick and rich, sweet style Rieslings can do anything! Listed here from least to most residual sugar.

2019 Lark Hill Ley-Line  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Pale yellow, medium-bodied sticky with zingy acidity and beautiful ripe pineapple palate.

2019 Frogmore Creek Iced Riesling  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish. 

2017 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 150 bottle
Dense and concentrated. Raisin and crispy citrus on the nose give way to stonefruit and white cherry on the palate. Incredible booze. Still has a zippy acid backbone underneath all that fleshy goodness.
