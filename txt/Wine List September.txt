We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some forgotten relatives of Riesling, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 

Hall - 25km North West

2019 Nick O’Leary Heywood  | 75 bottle 
Exceptional value single-site Riesling. Citrus and hints of crisp green melon. Perfect with fresh oysters and seafood or use it to cut through fatty fried foods. 

2018 Brindabella Hills | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Classic Canberra Riesling from the hills overlooking the Murrumbidgee about 35kms WNW of Canberra. Dry with heaps of citrus on the nose and palate. Great clean finish.

2012 Nick O’Leary back-vintage  | 80 bottle 
Straight from the personal stash, this belter vintage has softened and aged nicely creating character and complexity. 


Murrumbateman | Jeir – 35km to 45km NNW

2018 Ravensworth Estate  | 75 bottle
A more complex creation; a good bit of texture, from ceramic egg fermentation, but still lets the fruit shine. Layered; a real thinkers Rizla. 

2019 Helm Half Dry  | 55 bottle | 13 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.

2019 Four Winds | 60 bottle | 14 glass
An off-dry style; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from an excellent producer. 

2018 Helm Premium  | 85 bottle
Brilliantly concentrated citrus and crunchy apple. Absolutely mouthwatering intensity. A benchmark of the Australian Riesling scene. 

2018 Clonakilla | 70 bottle | 18 glass
Power and precision, like all Clonakilla wines. Buckets of lime, super tight acidity and it just keeps going and going…

2019 Poachers Pantry | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Fresh acidity, loads of limes and nice floral notes. Makes the palate salivate. Good wine, good young winemaker. 
2018 Yarrh | 50 bottle | 12 glass
Sharp citrus and minerality. Dry, light and moorish. Great value classic Canberra style Riesling from just north of Murrumbateman. 




Bungendore | Collector | Lake George | CBR - doorstep to 30km ENE + 50KM NNE

2018 Nick O’Leary White Rocks  | 85 bottle
This will be spoken about in revered tones in years to come; a brilliant wine showing the intensity and balance of great Canberra Rieslings. Taken from the Lake George Winery site on the edge of Lake George. Jump on and enjoy the ride. 

2019 Lark Hill Canberra Region  | 55 bottle 
Floral nose, zesty citrus on the palate. Bright and delicious. Mostly from the Freeman vineyard at Young, thus the ‘region’ and not ‘district’ tagline (but made at the home base at Bungendore). 

2019 Mount Majura | 65 bottle 
Juicy lemon palate with a long steely finish. Superbly balanced and quintessentially Canberran. Reliably great Riesling year in, year out. 

2019 Sapling Yard Bungendore  | 65 bottle | 15 glass
Lush floral nose followed by racy acidity and effervescence on the front palate. Good balance and tight minerality. Good long finish. Winemaker Carla Rodeghiero is also vigneron, picker and delivery driver – talk about a one-woman show!


The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 11 glass
Pinot+Chard method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2019 Four Winds Sparkling | Murrumbateman, Canberra District | 60 bottle 
Crisp grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose and on the palate, light and frehs with zingy acidity. Refreshing. Spring in a glass.

Crisp green apple, sherbet lemon drops. Lightly sparkling pet nat, perfect with food. 

2011 Lark Hill Chardonnay Pinot Noir | Bungendore, Canberra District | 110 bottle

NV Jacquesson Cuvee 741  | Champagne, France | 165 bottle | 30 glass
Full nose of bread and honey, a soft bead, citrus and melon palate, crisp finish. The French doing what the French do damn well. 





Aussie Riesling

Kaffir lime, apple and lemon on the palate. Another precise example from the Clare. 

2019 Vinteloper | Clare Valley, SA | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Subtle nose of Slate and lemon juice. Floral mid palate and a dry finish creating an irresistible salavating effect. Winner.

2008 Pikes Merle  | Clare Valley, SA | 120 bottle 
An aged edge to the classic Clare characteristics of minerality and citrus. One of Australia’s premier Rieslings.

2018 Robert Stein Half Dry  | Mudgee, NSW | 70 bottle

Beautiful old girls
Aged Rieslings; a ‘gift that keeps on giving,’ as cousin Eddie would say..

2012 Nick O’Leary back-vintage  | Canberra District | 80 bottle
Time hasn’t changed the way I feel about this one. A cracker year, great producer, classic Canberra Rizla with citrus and now an added complexity from age. 

2008 Pikes Merle  | Clare Valley, SA | 125 bottle 
An aged edge to the classic Clare characteristics of minerality and citrus. One of Australia’s premier Rieslings.

2009 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 90 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser has made a brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2009 was a slightly warmer year, creating a Riesling with white peach, floral and citrus notes with a bit of sweetness to balance the acidity. 


International Rieslings
The Georgians started it, the Austrians claim it, the Germans own it

2016 Domaine Weinbach Cuvee Colette | Alsace, France | 200 bottle
Racy, dry and spicy. Super dry for Alsace. Mixed citrus and white pepper notes. Super old vines, mainly from the famed Schlossberg vineyard but missing the Grand Cru classification. One of the French greats. 

2009 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 90 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser has made a brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2009 was a slightly warmer year, creating a Riesling with white peach, floral and citrus notes with a bit of sweetness to balance the acidity. 





This is for the G’s 
The imitators, the long lost cousins of Riesling

2018 Long Rail Gully Pinot Gris | Murrumbateman, CBR | 55 bottle | 13 glass

Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak, a real thinker’s white. 

2018 Nick Spencer Gruner Veltliner | Tumbarumba, NSW | 60 bottle
Green apple and grapefruit with subtle white pepper on the palate and tight acidity. 

2018 Suavia Classico Soave  | Veneto, Italy | 70 bottle
Buckets of citrus, balanced acidity and an unmistakably fresh Garganega character. Top notch Italian white, their own answer to Riesling.  


Worthy & worldly Whites
2012 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 75 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. 

2018 Vinden Estate Verdelho | Hunter Valley, NSW | 50 bottle | 12 glass 	
Ripe tropical fruit, medium-bodied, tight acidity. None of that chalky texture that plagues this Portuguese workhorse.

Fresh apricot, almond and spice, a clean and dry style Viognier. 

2018 Langlois-Chateau Chenin Blanc | Loire Valley, France | 60 bottle

A concise list of Red Wines

2018 Long Rail Gully FMG Gamay | Murrumbateman, CBR | 80 bottle | 18 glass

2016 Hahndorf Hill Blueblood Blaufranckisch | Adelaide Hills, SA | 90 bottle
‘Pinot with stubble’. Copious blue fruits and cherry on the palate with a distinct spice element. Australians doing Austrian stuff very, very well. 

2017 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, Canberra District | 210 bottle 
The Ron Burgundy of Canberra reds; it’s kind of a big deal. Super vintage of a super wine; elegant, perfumed, precise, medium-bodied. Simply a great wine. 

2017 Nick O’Leary Heywood Shiraz | Hall, Canberra District | 80 bottle | 18 glass
Canberra shiraz to a Tee; red fruit and white pepper on the nose, little darker on the palate. Due to be another ‘big thing’ from Nick. 

2018 Sholto Syrah | Gundaroo, Canberra District | 70 bottle
Copious blackcurrant and spicy plums, this wine definitely gets better with time in a decanter. Give it a good hour with some air and, as the kids say, O M G. Well balanced, light yet lush, and worthy of its recent accolades. 

2018 Mount Majura Mondeuse | Majura, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 14 glass
Spicy dark fruit on the palate, juicy and vibrant. Great value medium-bodied booze.

2008 Torbreck The Pict Mataro | Barossa Valley, SA | 250 magnum 
Mulberry and dried plums, with that mataro spice fruit cake love. Full-bodied, structured, good tannins, they did good for a heatwave year. A big wine in a big bottle. 

2018 Vinteloper Touriga Nacional | Langhorne Creek, SA | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Rich nose, velvety in the mouth, but still really bright and spicy. Goes from thick and rich to light and dry. Good times had for all red drinkers.  

2017 Fraser Gallop Palladian Cabernet Sauvignon | Margaret River, WA | 160 bottle
Leads with an intense nose of blackcurrant and violet, leading in to a concentrated and elegant palate. Phenomenal tannins and texture. Perfect Margaret River Cab Sauv.
