We’re all about the Riesling. 

In winter we’re all about the Shiraz. 

So… lets call this ‘Rizla does Razla’. 

Yes, we’ve got phenomenal drops besides Rizla and Razla; there’s some Riesling impersonators like your Gris and Gruner, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles, some serious bubbles, and a short list of seriously good ‘other’ reds. 

But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘king and queen of grapes in Canberra’ and their ability to go with such a diverse range of cuisines.  

The Canberra District has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past two decades, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!

Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 
50-odd producers, 70-odd Rieslings in a vintage. This is just a list of highlights

2019 Brindabella Hills | Hall | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Classic Canberra Riesling from the hills overlooking the Murrumbidgee about 35kms WNW of Canberra. Dry with heaps of citrus on the nose and palate. 

2021 Sapling Yard Lake George  | Lake George | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Utterly delicious. One of our new faves. Why? It’s got a delicate citrus nose like a classic CBR Riz, fresh cut tart green apple, soft lime and subtle spice on the palate. There’s balance, superb length and a silky mouthfeel. Snaps for Sapling. 

2021 Clonakilla | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle 
Power and precision, like all Clonakilla wines. Kaffir lime skin and delicate floral notes on the nose, clean and dry with a lovely little talc kiss on the finish. 

2017 Collector City West  | Tumbarumba | 80 bottle
Tumby is heavily raided by CBR makers so lets just go right ahead and claim it as a CBR sub-region, shall we? This is showing aged complexity, deep minerality and herbaceous tones on the nose; then a curious mix of mandarin, cumquat and fennel seed on the palate. Long, lingering finish. 

2019 Helm Classic  | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle 
Classic for a reason. Crisp lime and lemon juice aromas, Canberra minerality. Dry as could be. Perfect young, definitely ageable, good value. 

2021 Nick O’Leary Heywood  | Hall  | 75 bottle
Exceptional value single-site Riesling from Nick’s home plot. Citrus and hints of crisp green melon. Well balanced acidity. Classic Nick.   
 
2014 Lark Hill Estate  back-vintage | Bungendore | 130 bottle  
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. A veritable bevvy of citrus on the palate. Great length. Wildly enjoyable. Biodynamic.  

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2016 Ravensworth back-vintage | Murrumbateman | 100 bottle 
Lively lemon and fennel on the nose, bright and steely on the front palate. Starting to show some age but this will live for another 15 years plus.

2019 Sholto | Murrumbateman | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Rich floral nose, with a sweetness taken back by clean acidity and tight texture. Orange, pear and mandarin on the palate. Dry finish. Super quirky and different for CBR Riesling and highly enjoyable. 

2021 Lark Hill Regional  |  Young, NSW & Bungendore, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Super bright fresh tropical nose, crisp honeydew, guava and grapefruit on the palate. Sweet, light and low in alcohol. Very german iteration for a Canberra Riz.

2019 Helm Half Dry  | Murrumbateman | 55 bottle | 14 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.
Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2017 Clos Clare | Clare Valley, SA | 150 magnum 
What would the Barry family know about Riesling? Everything. Lemon and lime on the nose, balanced citrus and acidity throughout the palate. Another beauty and great value in the magnum. 
  
2021 Adelina Polish Hill River  | Clare Valley, SA | 65 bottle 
Light and clean on the nose, lime juice and earthy palate. The citrus pith and juiciness drives it long before going in to a mad drift around an crunchy apple roundabout. Its light, lean and fresh as you’d expect from a brand new vintage.

2014 Place In Time | Clare Valley, SA | 100 bottle
Heard of Pike’s Riesling? Of course you have. Chief winemaker Steve Baraglia also has this as his side-hustle. 2014 still has years to run, searing acidity and that classic Clare lime juice and structure.

2017 Loosen-Barry Wolta Wolta  | Clare Valley, SA | 180 bottle 
A marriage of ‘royal’ families; the Barry’s from Clare and the Loosen’s from Mosel in Germany. The result? A spectacular example of Clare Riesling. Ripe lime and white nectarine on the nose and palate, fine texture and complex. 

2020 Ministry of Clouds | Clare Valley, SA | 75 bottle 
Generous citrus nose, deceptively soft on the front palate too. Then, whoompa! There’s that Clare acidity and sharpness. A classic in the making.

2007 Clos Clare Museum Release  | Clare Valley, SA | 90 bottle 
Rich lime skins and lanolin on the nose, a toasted nuttiness even. Soft lime cordial and slight floral tones on the palate. Remarkably fresh for its age, but that says a lot for the makers and the vineyard. 

2020 Poppelvej ØST | Adelaide Hills, SA | 85 bottle
Cloudy pear juice to the eye, bursting with crispy dry lemon juice and chamomile on the nose and palate. Grippy from 3 weeks on skins. An undertone of caramel. Complex and delicious in moderation. 

2019 Frankland Estate Alter Weg  | Frankland River, WA | 80 bottle  
Alter Weg = The Old Way. Barrel ferment dry riesling from Frankland River WA. Tight acidity matched by a food friendly palate weight. Delicious and complex. 

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. An aged beauty. 

2017  Waterton Hall | Tamar Valley, Tas | 70 bottle | 17 glass
From the very edge of the Tamar River, made by Brian Croser (and Co.) A super aged nose to something still quite young, slate, lime and floral notes. 
2020 Stargazer | Coal River Valley, Tas | 90 bottle 
There’s something almost GG Germanic about this one. Is it the tropical fruit bowl nose? The sharp but restrained acidity? The flintiness bubbling away under it all? I can’t put my finger on it. But, its damn fine booze. 
International Rieslings
The old world gets pretty worked up about who ‘owns’ Riesling. The Germans, the Austrians, the French. For us: who cares? Just drink the stuff. 

2019 Dr Loosen Dr L  | Mosel, Germany | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Charred pineapple and subtle lychee on the nose. Vibrant palate with tight acidity and sweet tropical fruit. Balanced and extremely smashable. Bargain. Not the Mosel of old, thankfully. 

2018 Markus Molitor Klosterberg | Mosel, Germany | 85 bottle 
Subtle aromas for such a generous and well-balanced Riesling. Crisp green apple and honey contrasted with piercing acidity and a long slatey finish.

2018 A Christmann IDIG  GG | Pfalz, Germany | 250 bottle 
Spice, herb and tropical fruit on the nose, then hitting the lemon curd/apple spectrum that’s a bit more familiar to an Aussie palate. Powerful, and an intense long finish. 

2019 Robert Weil Kiedrich Grafenberg  GG  | Rheinhessen, Germany | 280 bottle
From a site classified as GG or equivalent since the 1860s. Super fine and intense dry example with pure pink grapefruit, lemon and white stonefruit. Crazy long and slightly savoury finish.  

2018 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Kabinett | Mosel, Germany | 175 bottle
Deep white fruit, quince and packed to the brim with blossom on the nose with distinct slateyness and the typical kabinett pang of sugar and acidity. Elegant as all Prums, and ageing gracefully. 

2018 Angsar Clusserath Apotheke  Spatlese | Mosel, Germany | 125 bottle
Ripened apple, grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose with a layer of floral and menthol notes. Palate of juicy fruit, fine acidity, long finish. Super. 

2016 Groiss Ried Auf Der Henne  Reserve | Weinviertel, Austria | 150 bottle 
White blossoms and stonefruit on the nose and palate. A nip of residual but well balanced. 12hr maceration on skins and and 10 months on lees means there is serious texture and volume. Complex. Brilliant. Take your time. 

2014 FX Pichler Loibenberg Smaragd  | Wachau, Austria | 160 bottle 
Floral nose with just a slight smokiness to it. From a warmer site and thus a slightly richer Riesling than is typical from Wachau. Lush palate lemon and grapefruit on the palate, creamy texture and sustained complex finish. 

2019 Paul Blanck | Alsace, France | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Beautifully ripe pineapple, grapefruit and honeydew on the nose. Well balanced on the palate with acid and sugar tingling the senses and a distinct Alsace minerality lingering finish. Impressive and good value for imported. 

2017 Domaine Ostertag Muenchberg Grand Cru  | Alsace, France | 170  bottle
Apricots and peaches, with a well integrated spice and a hint of saline. This Grand Cru block was first planted in the 12th Century by Cistercian monks. 

2011 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 80 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser makes brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2014 was a cooler year, and this is a ripe Riesling with tropical fruit on the nose, citrus on the palate and a racy acidity.


Tim’s Page
Who is Tim? Tim is your mate. You know? The fella with discerning taste, loves dry wines with a bit of a backstory or a bit of age on them. Or both. He’s keen for a chat, and knows heaps more about wine than Andy. So here’s to you Tim – enjoy some speccy’s ordered in with you in mind.

2014 Lark Hill Estate  back-vintage | Bungendore | 130 bottle  
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. A veritable bevvy of citrus on the palate. Great length. Wildly enjoyable. Biodynamic.  

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. We also have some of the 2008 Premium hanging about, not cold though. 

2017  Waterton Hall | Tamar Valley, Tas | 70 bottle | 17 glass
From the very edge of the Tamar River, made by Brian Croser (and Co.) A super aged nose to something still quite young, slate, lime and floral notes. Drinking heaps better and older than its age would suggest. 
2007 Clos Clare Museum Release | Clare Valley, SA | 90 bottle 
Rich lime skins and lanolin on the nose, a toasted nuttiness even. Soft lime cordial and slight floral tones on the palate. Remarkably fresh for its age, but that says a lot for the makers and the vineyard. 

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. An aged beauty. 

2016 Groiss Ried Auf Der Henne  Reserve | Weinviertel, Austria | 150 bottle 
White blossoms and stonefruit on the nose and palate. A nip of residual but well balanced. 12hr maceration on skins and and 10 months on lees means there is serious texture and volume. Complex. Brilliant. Take your time. 

2014 Place In Time | Clare Valley, SA | 100 bottle
Heard of Pike’s Riesling? Of course you have. Chief winemaker Steve Baraglia also has this as his side-hustle and it’s safe to say he knows his way around a RIelsing vintage or two. 2014 still has years to run, searing acidity and that classic Clare lime juice and structure.

2011 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 80 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser makes brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2011 was a cooler year, and this is a ripe Riesling with tropical fruit on the nose, citrus on the palate and a racy acidity.

2014 Eden Road 94 Block  Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 90 bottle 
Shiraz exclusively from the Eden Road home block a few clicks south of Murrumbateman. Pristine quality fruit, all red and blue, light Sichuan pepper through the palate. Fine french oak is evident. Phenomenal length and finish. 

This is for the G’s 
The imitators of, and close friends to, Riesling

2019 Long Rail Gully Pinot Gris | Murrumbateman, CBR | 60 bottle 
Bright pear and sweet apple, juicy, little bit of spice and white pepper, Great mouthfeel. Smashable booze by the folks at Long Rail Gully.  

2018 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 130 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak and in bottle, a real thinker’s white. Pioneers here in Canberra and recognized as one of the country’s best GV producers.

2020 Groiss Gruner Veltliner | Weinviertel, Austria | 65 bottle | 16 glass	
Fresh pressed Packham pear juice and a light pepperiness from the satart of the nose to the back of the palate. A medley of white peach towards the end to join the fight. Delicious, light, and the dry finish is as enjoyable and salivating as a big whiff of Smith’s salt & vinegar chippos. 

2020 Hahndorf Hill Gru  Gruner Veltliner | Adelaide Hills, SA | 70 bottle 
Citrus, nectarine and spice on the nose; stonefruit and grapefruit on the palate finished by a long mineral finish with a bit of texture. Highly acclaimed and great value Aussie Gruner. 

Worthy & worldly Whites
2014 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. You’d have no idea its 7-years old, still as fresh as tomorrow. 

2015 L.A.S Vino CBDB  | Margaret River, WA | 120 bottle 
100% chenin blanc from Margaret River is given the full treatment; wild yeast ferment, French barriques and clay amphora, lees stirring. The result is a textured, layered wine with a tonne of character and integrated fruit from grapefruit to lime and passionfruit. Awesome. 

2019 Eden Road Chardonnay | Tumbarumba, NSW | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Celine Rousseau has been turning out Chardonnay from Tumbarumba since I was in nappies (almost). This is so well balanced its scary. Delicious ripened stonefruit over grapefruit and toasty bready notes. Its generous without being flabby. Complex. Alluring. Very drinkable, most importantly. 

2017 Fighting Gully Road Chardonnay | Beechworth, Vic | 90 bottle  
A generous chardonnay from a top vineyard from one of Australia’s top regions from one of Australia’s best wine makers Adrian Rodda. Winning so far? Wait till you drink it; an abundance of character thanks to wild ferment in French oak, a powerful balance between stonefruit and citrus characters and a super clean finish. Awesome Chardy.  

2020 Mada Wines Sui Generis VI  Vermentino  | Riverlands, SA | 80 bottle 
Skin contact Vermentino by Hamish young, grown under organic practices by Ash Ratcliff at Ricca Terrra. 6 weeks on skins so no doubt about a textural hit to start but delightfully lush mouthfeel, primary fruits of spiced apricot and almond. Very clean lo-fi wine. Hip, but not too hip. 


The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

2021 Four Winds Sparkling Riesling | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Crisp grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose and on the palate, light and fresh with zingy acidity. Refreshing. Spring in a glass.  

2018 Mount Majura Silurian  PN + Chardy | Majura, CBR | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle grown up the road (about 10km North). Citrus, fresh cut pear and minerals. A light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2015 Daosa Blanc de Blanc  | Adelaide Hills, SA | 145 bottle
100% chardy from the Piccadilly Valley and arguably one of Australia’s best vintage BdBs. 30 Months on lees. Medium yellow in the glass, nougat and nutty goodness on the nose, generous richness of fruit through the spectrum; tropical to citrus and stonefruit. Long dry finish. Better than champagne?

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 

Rose 
Pretty, pretty dry, and pretty good with arvo sunshine

2021 Nick Spencer | Hilltops, NSW | 65 bottle 
A dry provence-style Rose from Mediterranean varietals Grenache, Sangiovese and Graciano. Pale salmon in the glass, floral red fruits on the nose. Clean and a slight savouriness to the finish. 

2020 Charles Melton There’s a Rose in Spanish Harlem | Barossa, SA | 75 bottle 
Not served cold. This straddles the void between Rose and red. Blended and effectively a non-vintage wine grabbing reserve parcels of reds from the past few vintages and turning out a total curiosity; deep ruby colour, spicy and complex. Redcurrant over flower petals with a super clean mouthfeel. Like I said; kinda like a light red. 

2021 Vintner’s Daughter | Murrumbateman, CBR | 60 bottle 
A luminescent salmon pink blush, Vibrant sweet perfumed nose of the season’s first strawberries and cream. Made from Hilltops Sangiovese and estate grown Shiraz and Merlot. Light, and sweeter than our other rose’s but still not a sweet rose. 

2021 Sapling Yard Rose | Canberra District, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Grenache from Hilltops NSW and the Gamay component from Braidwood. Dry and floral on the nose, with red currant and dried apple on the palate. A pretty wine, definitely dry with a savoury slick finish.


A Concise list of Reds
Listed lightest to heaviest, kinda

2019 Linear Pinot Noir | Tumbarumba, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass 
Distinct deep fleshy red cherry on the nose with a hint of savouriness. Cherry and red plum again on the palate, with a complex of smoky nuttiness. Super fine tannin. Well balanced.  

2016 Pressing Matters Pinot Noir | Coal River Valley, Tas | 170 bottle
Pressing Matters does Riesling and Pinot Noir. That’s all. And they’re damn good at them. Light in the glass, Red and dark cherry on the palate, super fine tannin. Sweet then a slight savoury and earthy finish. Intriguing Pinot.

2018 Koehler-Ruprecht Pinot Noir | Pfalz, Germany | 80 bottle 
Deep brooding pinot from Pfalz. A generous nose of dark cherry and light smokiness. Medium palate weight, long finish. Total surprise packet. 

2019 Intrepido Spanna in the Works  Nebbiolo | Pyrenees, Vic | 75 bottle 
Delightful, youthful light dry red. Really pretty nose of red fruit and peppers. Great grip through the mid palate. Light as a pinot, as dry as a shiraz. Silky. The perfect food wine? Its up there. 

2019 SC Pannell Aglianico | McLaren Vale, SA | 80 bottle 
Cherry and black pepper on the nose, juicy yet dry. Lingers long and delicate. The epitome of light dry red from McLaren Vale. Aglianico loiters somewhere between a Pinot and Shiraz and this is smack dab in the middle. Delish.

2018 Hahndorf Hill Blueblood  Blaufranckisch | Adelaide Hills, SA | 90 bottle
‘Pinot with stubble’. Copious blue fruits and cherry on the palate with a distinct spice element. Australians doing Austrian stuff very, very well. 

2019 Ministry of Clouds Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 80 bottle 
A 98-yr old bush vine vineyard in Blewitt Springs. So it’s good. Good fruit weight, richer style with hints of spice through the palate. Really well made. Good structure and acidity. Perfectly hitting that medium bodied red pitch. 

2017 Mount Mary Quintet  Cabernet Blend | Yarra Valley, Vic | 220 bottle
A flagship Aussie Cabernet blend; violet and red fruits on the nose, elegant bright palate. Due to live another 30+ years so best give us a heads up early so we can decant it for a solid hour before drinking. 

2016 Lark Hill Scuro  Sangiovese + Shiraz | Murrumbateman, CBR | 130 bottle 
A blend of Sangiovese and Shiraz grown on Lark Hill’s Dark Horse Vineyard  at murrumbateman. Rich, intense, dark and generous. Still that lovely CBR shiraz perfume but some power and weight to it. 

2018 Ringbolt Cabernet Sauvignon | Margaret River, WA | 65 bottle 
Delightful, youthful medium-heavy red. Classic Margs nose of blue and black fruit, the slightest whisp of eucalypt. More blue and black ripe fruit on the palate, lick of liquorice, clean but not overbearing tannins, silky finish. Value.

2011 Hans Herzog Zweigelt | Marlborough, NZ | 165 bottle 
Blackberry and currant on the strong deep nose, rich earthy tones. Silky mouthfeel with generous plum, cherry and choc. Defined tannins and acidity. A cracking, deep red from one of NZ’s pioneers. Unfined unfiltered. Magic. 
Rizla does Razla
Canberra Shiraz is more than just Clonakilla and Nick O’Leary, as great as they are

2017 Rocky Gully Shiraz | Frankland River, WA | 60 bottle 
A brilliant, light expression of Shiraz with remarkable similarities to Canberra District; red fruit, white pepper on the nose and palate, spice and perfume. 

2017 Sholto Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
A very pretty and light expression of CBR Razla. Red fruit, spice and Sichuan on the nose with a slight smoked meat  character.  Delectable soft fruit and fine tannin on the palate. Really enjoyable light dry red. 

2019 Long Rail Gully Shiraz | Murrumbateman, CBR | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Red berries, spice and liquorice on the nose, light and juicy on the palate; red fruit turning to dark cherry and blood plum through the palate. Allrounder.  

2014 Eden Road 94 Block  Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 90 bottle 
Shiraz exclusively from the Eden Road home block a few clicks south of Murrumbateman. Pristine quality fruit, all red and blue, light Sichuan pepper through the palate. Fine french oak is evident. Phenomenal length and finish. 

2018 Te Mata Bullnose  Syrah | Hawke’s Bay, NZ | 140 bottle 
An Iconic Syrah from a single vineyard in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand. Perfume and spice on the nose, richly blue + red fruits galore, and a fine silky finish. 

2019 Ravensworth Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 115 bottle 
In one word? Super. Super floral and brambly nose. Super red fruit and white pepper on the palate. Super use of fine European oak equals super fine tannins and a super finish. Like I said, just super. 

2016 Grove Estate Shiraz Viognier | Hilltops, NSW | 75 bottle | 18 glass
A bargain SV from near Young NSW. Perfumed nose as is to be expected, medium weighted fruit, well balanced between the light perfume and dense red fruit characters. Has benefited and softened from a few years in bottle. 

2016 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 260 bottle 
The Ron Burgundy of Canberra reds; it’s kind of a big deal. Great vintage of a super wine; elegant, perfumed, precise, medium-bodied. Simply a great wine and a main reason behind Clonakilla being the flagship of Murrumbateman. 

2005 Grant Burge Filsell  Shiraz | Barossa Valley, SA | 175 bottle 
An Icon. Great value Barossa Shiraz in its youth, but you’re welcome for my patience; I’ve been holding on to this for more than a decade waiting for the right moment. Liquorice, vanilla and spice, dark choc, fine tannins, rich fruit. 

2017 Quin Wines Shiraz | Barossa Valley, SA | 110 bottle 
Deep classic Barossa Shiraz from the winemaker behind Hentley Farm and Ricca Terra. Generous fruit with a super clean mouthfeel and a long, delicious finish resonant of red and black berries and a tidy oak influence.  

2013 Penley Estate Scottsburn  Cab + Shiraz | Coonawarra, SA | 80 bottle | 19 glass 
Reward yourself with a cracking example of Australia’s signature heavy red blend. Cabernet dominates the earthy nose, leading to a juicy dark palate – plum, dark cherry, dark choc – and finishing long and dry. 


Dessert style Rieslings 
From beautifully light, to thick and rich, sweet style Rieslings can do anything! Listed here from least to most residual sugar.

2019 Lark Hill Ley-Line  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Pale yellow, medium-bodied sticky with zingy acidity and beautiful ripe pineapple palate.

2020 Frogmore Creek Iced Riesling  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish. 

2017 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 150 bottle
Dense and concentrated. Raisin and crispy citrus on the nose give way to stonefruit and white cherry on the palate. Incredible booze. Still has a zippy acid backbone underneath all that fleshy goodness.
