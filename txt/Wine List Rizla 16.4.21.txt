We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some Riesling impersonators, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 
50-odd producers, 70-odd Rieslings in a vintage. This is just a rotating list of highlights

2019 Sapling Yard Bungendore  | Bungendore | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Lush floral nose followed by racy lemony acidity and effervescence on the front palate. Good balance and tight minerality. Good long finish. Winemaker Carla Rodeghiero is also vigneron, picker and delivery driver!

2019 Lake George Winery Ryder  | Lake George | 65 bottle 
P O W E R. Super intense lime juice palate with searing acidity. One for the hardened fans of dry Riesling, and definitely has the bones to age well. 

2018 Brindabella Hills | Hall | 60 bottle 
Classic Canberra Riesling from the hills overlooking the Murrumbidgee about 35kms WNW of Canberra. Dry with heaps of citrus on the nose and palate. 

2019 Long Rail Gully | Murrumbateman | 60 bottle | 15 Glass
A light and aromatic style, with dried mandarin on the nose and fresh lime juice on the palate. An enduring clean finish. Very good.

2017 Nick O’Leary White Rocks  | Lake George | 90 bottle
This will be spoken about in revered tones in years to come; a brilliant wine showing the intensity and balance of great Canberra Rieslings. Taken from the Lake George Winery site on the edge of Lake George. 

2019 Helm Classic  | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle 
Classic for a reason. Crisp lime and lemon juice aromas, Canberra minerality. Dry as could be. Perfect young, definitely ageable, good value. 

2019 Clonakilla | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle  
Power and precision, like all Clonakilla wines. Buckets of lime, super tight acidity and it just keeps going and going… 

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2014 Lark Hill Estate  back-vintage | Bungendore | 130 bottle  
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. A veritable bevvy of citrus on the palate. Great length. Wildly enjoyable. Biodynamic.  

2016 Ravensworth back-vintage | Murrumbateman | 100 bottle 
Lively lemon and fennel on the nose, bright and steely on the front palate. Starting to show some age but this will live for another 15 years plus.

2019 Sholto | Murrumbateman | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Rich floral nose, with a sweetness taken back by clean acidity and tight texture. Orange, pear and mandarin on the palate. Dry finish. Super quirky and different for CBR Riesling and highly enjoyable. 

2019 Helm Half Dry  | Murrumbateman | 55 bottle | 14 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.
Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2019 Grosset Polish Hill  | Clare Valley, SA | 230 magnum 
THE definitive Clare; bone dry, intense citrus and cool slate with a persistent finish. Everything tastes better from a magnum. 

2018 Vanguardist | Clare Valley, SA | 85 bottle 
Judging this book by its cover it’s a solid 10; cloth label, wax-dipped cork. Beauty. What’s inside is just as good; extended time on skins and a variety of fermentation techniques creates layers of complex citrus and apple but in no way hiding the brightness of Clare. My new fave from SA. 
2017 Loosen-Barry Wolta Wolta  | Clare Valley, SA | 180 bottle 
A marriage of ‘royal’ families; the Barry’s from Clare and the Loosen’s from Mosel in Germany. The result? A spectacular example of Clare Riesling. Ripe lime and white nectarine on the nose and palate, fine texture and complex. 

2019 Sons of Eden Freya  | Eden Valley, SA | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Light and clean on the nose, a flush of crisp citrus blossom and lemon juice on the palate. A hint of savouriness and a long bouncy finish. A cracker. 

2020 Poppelvej ØST | Adelaide Hills, SA | 85 bottle
Cloudy pear juice to the eye, bursting with crispy dry lemon juice and chamomile on the nose and palate. Grippy from 3 weeks on skins. An undertone of caramel. Complex and delicious in moderation. 

2010 Pizzini Museum Release | King Valley, Vic | 80 bottle | 20 glass
Rich citrus oils and grapefruit zest on the nose. Steely acidity with an ensemble of warm tangerine and orange marmalade characters. A tingle of acidity right to the end. Belter of an aged Riesling. 

2012 Crawford River | Henty, Vic | 185 bottle 
Mainland Australia’s foremost Riesling producer. Supreme ageability from super their site planted in the 1970’s in Henty. Still a youthful green, very delicate with soft floral notes on the nose, apple skins and a hint of white peach on the palate. Acidity has barely softened.

2019 Best’s Foudre Ferment  | Great Western, Vic | 75 bottle 
One of Australia’s finest Riesling producers. This one is fermented in 2500L+ Foudre to create texture and body. Still dry, but with a lovely creaminess and length. Pear and lime bounce around in a delicious dance.  

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. An aged beauty. 

2018 Stargazer Palisander Vineyard  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 100 bottle 
Steely nose, fresh light citrus, followed by a perfectly balanced palate; not overly dry or sweet. A melody of citrus from lime juice to fresh orange oil. One of the finest examples of crystalline dry white. 


International Rieslings
The old world gets pretty worked up about who ‘owns’ Riesling. The Germans, the Austrians, the French. For us: who cares? Just drink the stuff. 

2019 Donnhoff | Nahe, Germany | 75 bottle 
Soft and rounded nose, slightly floral, slightly sweet, with tropical fruit and pear on the palate. Light spritz. Great value German off-dry Rizla.

2017 A Christmann Reiterpfad-Hofstuck  GG | Pfalz, Germany | 250 bottle 
Spice, herb and tropical fruit on the nose, then hitting the lemon curd/apple spectrum that’s a bit more familiar to an Aussie palate. Powerful, and an intense long finish. 

2019 Wittmann Westhofener 1G  | Rheinhessen, Germany | 145 bottle
From the oldest patch on the premier cru site of the Westhofen Hills. Stonefruit, floral and a whiff of menthol on the nose. Super concentrated and pure stonefruit on the palate. Silky finish. 

2018 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Kabinett | Mosel, Germany | 175 bottle
Deep white fruit, quince and packed to the brim with blossom on the nose with distinct slateyness and the typical kabinett pang of sugar and acidity. Elegant as all Prums, and ageing gracefully. 

2018 Angsar Clusserath Apotheke  Spatlese | Mosel, Germany | 125 bottle
Ripened apple, grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose with a layer of floral and menthol notes. Palate of juicy fruit, fine acidity, long finish. Super. 

2015 Schafer-Frohlich Felseneck GG Spatlese | Nahe, Germany | 230 bottle
Grosse Gewachs Goldkapsel Riesling, which is to say it’s the best wine from the best vineyard in the winemakers opinion. This Spatlese is complex; white cherry and citrus zest on the nose, a deep slate minerality and fine acidity. 

2016 Groiss Ried Auf Der Henne  Reserve | Weinviertel, Austria | 150 bottle 
White blossoms and stonefruit on the nose and palate. A nip of residual but well balanced. 12hr maceration on skins and and 10 months on lees means there is serious texture and volume. Complex. Brilliant. Take your time. 

2019 Jean-Luc Mader | Alsace, France | 85 bottle | 22 glass
Beautifully ripe grapefruit, melon and pineapple on the nose. Well balanced on the palate with acid and sugar tingling the senses and a distinct minerality underneath it all. Long finish. Great value Frenchie.    

2018 Domaine Kirrenbourg Granitique | Alsace, Fra | 115 bottle
Zesty lemon on the nose and straw yellow in the glass. Plenty more citrus on the palate; lemon and grapefruit and hints of green apple. Dry, clean savoury. 

2018 Domaine Ostertag Les Jardins | Alsace, France | 260 magnum
White flowers, peach and vine-blossom aromas, followed by a rounded texture and a fine and long acidity. A slight saline character in the finish. Graceful Alsace. Biodynamic producer. 

2013 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 85 bottle | 20 glass
Aussie legend Brian Croser makes brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2013 was a cooler year, and this is a ripe Riesling with tropical fruit on the nose, citrus on the palate and a racy acidity.



The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 14 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2017 Wallaroo Sparkling Riesling | Hall, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Mouthfillng fizz, refreshing lemon on the palate with acid and sugar in great balance. Long finish with great texture. Highly enjoyable. 

2019 Mada Sui Generis  Pet Nat | Hilltops, NSW | 70 bottle
Fun funky bubbles from near Young NSW. Predominantly Nebbiolo grapes but a splash of Riesling and Chardonnay to add a bit of complexity and interest. Deep amber colour, grippy and textural, strawberries and peach on the palate. 

NV Louis Roederer Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 170 bottle
The epitome of straight-down-the-middle non vintage champagne; bright citrus and blossom, super fine bead, acidity balanced by supple yeast making for a toasty long finish. Practically sells itself. 

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 


Rose 
Pretty, pretty dry, and pretty good with arvo sunshine

2020 Freeman Rondo Rondinella Rose | Hilltops, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Very pretty aromatic nose of nectarine and currants. Red currants and berries on the palate, dry with a tight but not overbearing acidity. Complex and just the slightest savouriness on the finish. Truly delightful rose from a truly f***ed year. 
 
2019 Terre a Terre Piccadilly  |  Adelaide Hills, SA  |  70 bottle 
Pale pink, pretty nose. What more do you need? A blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% chardonnay grown in the Piccadilly valley subregion of Adelaide Hills. High quality, low production rose. 

2019 Commanderie de Preissan | Pays D’oc, Fra | 75 bottle
Salmon pink, and a classic dry style southern French rose. Strawberries and cream and redcurrants on the nose and palate, a little more complex than your average provence style but still refreshing and quaffable. 



This is for the G’s 
The imitators of, and close friends to, Riesling

2017 Topper’s Mountain Gewurztraminer | New England, NSW | 75 bottle 
Bone dry barrel fermented Gewurz from one of the coldest wine regions in Australia near Armidale, NSW. Aromatic lychee intertwined with spice and tropical fruit with zippy acidity balancing out the added texture from oak. 

2018 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 130 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak and in bottle, a real thinker’s white. Pioneers here in Canberra and recognized as one of the country’s best GV producers.

2020 Vinden Headcase Blanc  | Hunter Valley, NSW | 75 bottle	
So we’re just a wee bit excited about Vinden wines. A gun young winemaker making super interesting booze from a typically ‘conservative’ wine region. The 2020 blanc is anyone’s guess for what’s in it, but its textural, aromatic, dry and just really really good wine. One for the ‘skins’ and ‘natural wines’ crowd.

2020 Hahndorf Hill Gru  Gruner Veltliner | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Citrus, nectarine and spice on the nose; stonefruit and grapefruit on the palate finished by a long mineral finish with a bit of texture. 

Worthy & worldly Whites
2013 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. You’d have no idea its 7-years old, still as fresh as tomorrow. 

2020 Ravensworth The Long Way Around  Bianco | Swan Valley, WA | 70 bottle 
Twas a vintage to forget for CBR so Bryan looked far afield, and I mean faaaaarr afield to find some grapes to make good booze from. This Trebbiano, Gewurz and Riesling blend from Swan Valley and Great Southern WA is textural, aromatic, grippy and quirky like the man himself. Skins and stoneware ferment.

2015 L.A.S Vino CBDB  | Margaret River, WA | 120 bottle 
100% chenin blanc from Margaret River is given the full treatment; wild yeast ferment, French barriques and clay amphora, lees stirring. The result is a textured, layered wine with a tonne of character and integrated fruit from grapefruit to lime and passionfruit. Awesome. 

2013 Eden Road Chardonnay | Tumbarumba, NSW | 75 bottle | 18 glass
A classic vintage from a classic maker in a classic chardy style. Saw 25% new French oak barriques for 12 months so plenty of texture, but also plenty of vibrant stonefruit and citrus. Balanced and fine, on the bigger richer spectrum for chardy but a cracker while we can get it!

2017 Fighting Gully Road Chardonnay | Beechworth, Vic | 90 bottle  
A generous chardonnay from a top vineyard from one of Australia’s top regions from one of Australia’s best wine makers Adrian Rodda. Winning so far? Wait till you drink it; an abundance of character thanks to wild ferment in French oak, a powerful balance between stonefruit and citrus characters and a super clean finish. Awesome Chardy.  

A Concise list of Reds
Listed lightest to heaviest, kinda

2020 Brackenwood Pinot + Gamay | Adelaide Hills, SA | 70 bottle | 17 glass
A Super light red; bright fresh sweet cherry and raspberry on the nose with an underlying earthiness from the Gamay. Hint of spice, nice and bright.  

2019 Pooley Cooinda Vale  Pinot Noir | Coal River Valley, TAS | 140 bottle 
Magical pinot. Delicate and juicy at the same time, soft and structured, supple and bright. Red cherry and raspberry, a little savoury and a lengthy finish. Allow 30 minutes in a decanter to kick it in to gear though.

2020 Intrepido Nero’s Fiddle Nero d’Avola  | Mildura, Vic | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Delightful, dark rich fruit of plum and blackcurrant but a lightness to the palate makes it a phenomenal arvo wine over cheese. Juicy, medium, touch’o’spice. Well made Nero. 

2019 A Los Vinateros Bravos Pipeno Tinto | Itata Hills, Chile | 80 bottle | 16 glass   
An old bush vine Cinsault form the Itata Hills just south of Santiago. Unfined, unfiltered, unirrigated. Low intervention, low fuss funky red. A bit of a carbonic whiff to it but a delicious lightness on the palate, dried red fruit, spice and sansho pepper. 1000ml bottle. 

2019 Vanguardist Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 125 bottle
Graceful Grenache from the ‘silver sands’ vineyard at Blewitt Springs. Lots of concentrated red berry character and defined structure. Really good wine.  

2018 Ministry of Clouds Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 80 bottle 
A 98-yr old bush vine vineyard in Blewitt Springs. So it’s good. Good fruit weight, richer style with hints of spice through the palate. Really well made. Good structure and acidity. Perfectly hitting that medium bodied red pitch. 

2018 Mount Majura Lime Kiln Red  | Majura, CBR | 70 bottle 
A blend of estate grown Shiraz and Touriga. Choc, coffee and cherry on the nose. Medium palate weight with straight up spices and pepper on the front palate followed by red fruit and a silky finish. 

2019 Ravensworth Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 115 bottle 
In one word? Super. Super floral and brambly nose. Super red fruit and white pepper on the palate. Super use of fine European oak equals super fine tannins and a super finish. Like I said, just super. 

2018 Te Mata Bullnose Syrah | Hawke’s Bay, NZ | 140 bottle 
An Iconic single vineyard Syrah from Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand. Perfumed and spice on the nose, richly blue and red fruits galore, and a fine silky finish. 

2014 Penley Estate Scottsburn  Cab + Shiraz | Coonawarra, SA | 85 bottle | 20 glass 
Reward yourself with a cracking example of Australia’s signature heavy red blend. Cabernet dominates the earthy nose, leading to a juicy dark palate – plum, dark cherry, dark choc – and finishing long and dry. 

2011 Hans Herzog Zweigelt | Marlborough, NZ | 165 bottle 
Blackberry and currant on the strong deep nose, rich earthy tones. Silky mouthfeel with generous plum, cherry and choc. Defined tannins and acidity. A cracking, deep red from one of NZ’s pioneers. Unfined unfiltered. Magic. 

Dessert style Rieslings 
From beautifully light, to thick and rich, sweet style Rieslings can do anything! Listed here from least to most residual sugar.

2019 Lark Hill Ley-Line  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Pale yellow, medium-bodied sticky with zingy acidity and beautiful ripe pineapple palate.

2020 Frogmore Creek Iced Riesling  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish. 

2017 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 150 bottle
Dense and concentrated. Raisin and crispy citrus on the nose give way to stonefruit and white cherry on the palate. Incredible booze. Still has a zippy acid backbone underneath all that fleshy goodness.
