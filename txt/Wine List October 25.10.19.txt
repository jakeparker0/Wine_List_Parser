We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some forgotten relatives of Riesling, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 

Hall - 25km North West

2019 Nick O’Leary Heywood  | 75 bottle 
Exceptional value single-site Riesling. Citrus and hints of crisp green melon. Perfect with fresh oysters and seafood or use it to cut through fatty fried foods. 


Murrumbateman | Jeir – 35km to 45km NNW

2018 Ravensworth Estate  | 75 bottle
A more complex creation; a good bit of texture, from ceramic egg fermentation, but still lets the fruit shine. Layered; a real thinkers Rizla. 

2019 Helm Half Dry  | 55 bottle | 13 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.

2019 Four Winds | 60 bottle | 14 glass
An off-dry style; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from an excellent producer. 

2018 Helm Premium  | 85 bottle
Brilliantly concentrated citrus and crunchy apple. Absolutely mouthwatering intensity. A benchmark of the Australian Riesling scene. 

2018 Clonakilla | 80 bottle 
Power and precision, like all Clonakilla wines. Buckets of lime, super tight acidity and it just keeps going and going…

2019 Poachers Pantry | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Fresh acidity, loads of limes and nice floral notes. Makes the palate salivate. Good wine, good young winemaker. 
2018 Yarrh | 50 bottle | 12 glass
Sharp citrus and minerality. Dry, light and moorish. Great value classic Canberra style Riesling from just north of Murrumbateman. 

2018 Mada | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Dry, clean, light style Canberra Riesling. Really good acidity and nice subtle floral notes to go with the typical Canberra citrus and minerality. Good booze. 
2019 Gundog Estate | 80 bottle | 18 glass
Juicy lime, balanced acidity and minerality, slight floral note on the nose. From the Four Winds vineyard. Phenomenal booze, and worth hiding a few bottles for a decade…
2018 Gallagher | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Already showing signs of ageing; lemon curd, mandarin, honey, minerality. Superbly balanced, great finish. Clapping emoji.


Bungendore | Collector | Lake George | CBR - doorstep to 30km ENE + 50KM NNE

2018 Nick O’Leary White Rocks  | 85 bottle
This will be spoken about in revered tones in years to come; a brilliant wine showing the intensity and balance of great Canberra Rieslings. Taken from the Lake George Winery site on the edge of Lake George. Jump on and enjoy the ride. 

2019 Lark Hill Canberra Region  | 55 bottle 
Floral nose, zesty citrus on the palate. Bright and delicious. Mostly from the Freeman vineyard at Young, thus the ‘region’ and not ‘district’ tagline (but made at the home base at Bungendore). 

2019 Mount Majura | 65 bottle 
Juicy lemon palate with a long steely finish. Superbly balanced and quintessentially Canberran. Reliably great Riesling year in, year out. 

2019 Sapling Yard Bungendore  | 65 bottle | 15 glass
Lush floral nose followed by racy acidity and effervescence on the front palate. Good balance and tight minerality. Good long finish. Winemaker Carla Rodeghiero is also vigneron, picker and delivery driver – talk about a one-woman show!
2012 Lark Hill back-vintage  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 80 bottle
A cracker year, great producer, classic Canberra Rizla with citrus and now an added complexity from age. 



The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 13 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2019 Four Winds Sparkling Riesling | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle | 15 glass
Crisp grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose and on the palate, light and fresh with zingy acidity. Refreshing. Spring in a glass.  

2019 Ravensworth Ancestral  Riesling | Murrumbateman, CBR | 70 bottle 
Crisp green apple, sherbet lemon drops. Lightly sparkling, super cloudy pet nat, good grip and texture. Perfect with slightly richer food. 

2019 Gilbert Pet Nat Riesling | Orange, NSW | 65 bottle 
Mouthfilling dry fizz with a restrained citrus nose. Very approachable, borderline smashable. Made by up-and-coming winemaker Will Gilbert from Mudgee – watch this space.

2011 Lark Hill Chardonnay Pinot Noir | Bungendore, Canberra District | 110 bottle 
Probably the best vintage sparkling from mainland Aus, in our humble opinion. Comparable to your generous champagne styles; biscuits, honey, and crisp acidity. Yum.



Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2019 Grosset Polish Hill  | Clare Valley, SA | 230 magnum

2019 Ashton Hills Estate   | Adelaide Hills, SA | 80 bottle 
Clean zippy example from one of the Hills’ finest producers of any and all things. Plenty of lemon juice and floral notes.

A medium-dry Riesling with plenty of Lime notes and a good whack of residual sugar. Great for anything with a whack of chili. 

2018 Colmar Block 6  | Orange, NSW | 70 bottle
Phenomenal drinking right now, clean green apples, lemon, mandarin peel and minerality. The critics are all on this at the moment. 

2018 Tertini Yaraandoo | Southern Highlands, NSW | 75 bottle 
Good clean nose, sharp grippy acidity with a fresh citrus palate. Creates the salavating effect that makes you want more. Winner.

2018 Stefano Lubiana | Derwent Valley, Tas | 80 bottle
Deliciously light citrus, with a good mouthfeel coming from some time in old oak. Very good booze. Tassie wines, so hot right now, Tassie wines…

2018 Harewood Estate Porongurup  | Great Southern, WA | 75 bottle 
Apple blossom, loads of lemon and mineral intensity with an incredible, long finish. A rising star of WA.

A cracker year, great producer, classic Canberra Rizla with citrus and now an added complexity from age.

2009 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 90 bottle

International Rieslings
The Georgians started it, the Austrians fervently claim it, the Germans own it

2017 Donnhoff | Nahe, Germany | 80 bottle | 18 glass

2015 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 280 magnum

2017 Dr Loosen Wehlener Sonnenuhr Trocken GG | Mosel, Germany | 165 bottle 
Light and spritzy tropical fruit on the palate, a truly top tier ‘grand cru’ German. A persistent and delicate, pretty Riesling. Simply delicious.

Complex, with early signs of ageing yet very light and clean palate. 

2016 Domaine Weinbach Cuvee Colette | Alsace, France | 200 bottle
Racy, dry and spicy. Super dry for Alsace. Mixed citrus and white pepper notes. Super old vines, mainly from the famed Schlossberg vineyard but missing the Grand Cru classification. One of the French greats.

Beautifully ripe, lush nose with honey and floral notes followed by a well-balanced delivery of fruit and tight acidity. Absolute bargain frenchy.

The imitators, the long lost cousins of Riesling

2018 Long Rail Gully Pinot Gris | Murrumbateman, CBR | 55 bottle 
Bright pear and sweet apple, juicy, little bit of spice and white pepper, Great mouthfeel. Smashable booze by the folks at Long Rail Gully.

Dry style gris from just up the road; Stonefruit and pear juice with very subtle spice. Highly smashable. 

2018 Villa Wolf Gewurztraminer | Pfalz, Germany | 50 bottle | 12 glass
Typically bright lychee and spice on the nose, light rose petal, good mouthfeel, fresh and clean. Dry style gewurtz = good times.

Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak, a real thinker’s white.

Green apple and grapefruit with subtle white pepper on the palate and tight acidity. 

2018 Suavia Classico Soave  | Veneto, Italy | 70 bottle
Buckets of citrus, balanced acidity and an unmistakably fresh Garganega character. Top notch Italian white, their own answer to Riesling.  


Worthy & worldly Whites
2012 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. 

2018 Vinden Estate Verdelho | Hunter Valley, NSW | 50 bottle | 12 glass 	
Ripe tropical fruit, medium-bodied, tight acidity. None of that chalky texture that plagues this Portuguese workhorse.

A concise list of Red Wines

2018 Long Rail Gully FMG Gamay | Murrumbateman, CBR | 80 bottle | 18 glass

2016 Koehler-Ruprecht Pinot Noir | Pfalz, Germany | 75 bottle

2016 Hahndorf Hill Blueblood Blaufranckisch | Adelaide Hills, SA | 90 bottle

2017 Mckellar Ridge SV | Murrumbateman, Canberra District | 70 bottle | 16 glass

2018 Sholto Syrah | Gundaroo, Canberra District | 70 bottle
Copious blackcurrant and spicy plums, this wine definitely gets better with time in a decanter. Give it a good hour with some air and, as the kids say, O M G. Well balanced, light yet lush, and worthy of its recent accolades. 

2018 Mount Majura Mondeuse | Majura, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 14 glass
Spicy dark fruit on the palate, juicy and vibrant. Great value medium-bodied booze.

2008 Torbreck The Pict Mataro | Barossa Valley, SA | 250 magnum 
Mulberry and dried plums, with that mataro spice fruit cake love. Full-bodied, structured, good tannins, they did good for a heatwave year. A big wine in a big bottle. 

2018 Vinteloper Touriga Nacional | Langhorne Creek, SA | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Rich nose, velvety in the mouth, but still really bright and spicy. Goes from thick and rich to light and dry. Good times had for all red drinkers.  

2017 Fraser Gallop Palladian Cabernet Sauvignon | Margaret River, WA | 160 bottle
Leads with an intense nose of blackcurrant and violet, leading in to a concentrated and elegant palate. Phenomenal tannins and texture. Perfect Margaret River Cab Sauv.
