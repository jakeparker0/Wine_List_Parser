We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some Riesling impersonators, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 
50-odd producers, 70-odd Rieslings in a vintage. This is just a list of highlights

2021 Mount Majura | Majura | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Quintessential Canberra style; Juicy lime and lemon palate with secondary granny smith. Superbly balanced, dry and a long zingy finish. 

2021 Sapling Yard Lake George  | Lake George | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Utterly delicious. One of our new faves. Why? It’s got a delicate citrus nose like a classic CBR Riz, fresh cut tart green apple, soft lime and subtle spice on the palate. There’s balance, superb length and a silky mouthfeel. Snaps for Sapling. 

2021 Clonakilla | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle 
Power and precision, like all Clonakilla wines. Kaffir lime skin and delicate floral notes on the nose, clean and dry with a lovely little talc kiss on the finish. 

2017 Collector City West  | Tumbarumba | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Tumby is heavily raided by CBR makers so lets just go right ahead and claim it as a CBR sub-region, shall we? Complex, deep minerality and herbaceous tones on the nose; then a curious mix of mandarin, cumquat and fennel seed.

2019 Helm Classic  | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle 
Classic for a reason. Crisp lime and lemon juice aromas, Canberra minerality. Dry as could be. Perfect young, definitely ageable, good value. 

2021 Nick O’Leary Heywood  | Hall  | 75 bottle
Exceptional value single-site Riesling from Nick’s home plot. Citrus and hints of crisp green melon. Well balanced acidity. Classic Nick.   
 
2014 Lark Hill Estate  back-vintage | Bungendore | 130 bottle  
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. A veritable bevvy of citrus on the palate. Great length. Wildly enjoyable. Biodynamic.  

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2021 Eden Road | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle 
Soft and approachable in every sense. Makes it dangerously drinkable. Soft blossom and lemon pith nose, citrus dominant palate but restraint. Elegant.

2021 McKellar Ridge Reserve  | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle | 22 glass
Crunchy green apple and pineapple on the nose followed by searing lime juice cordial on the palate. Steely texture and a kiss of residual on the finish. Super dry, clean, crisp and fresh. Wowsers its got some length to it.
2019 Sholto | Murrumbateman | 75 bottle 
Rich floral nose, with a sweetness taken back by clean acidity and tight texture. Orange, pear and mandarin on the palate. Dry finish. Super quirky and different for CBR Riesling and highly enjoyable. 

2021 Helm Half Dry  | Murrumbateman | 60 bottle | 15 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.
Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2020 Brackenwood | Adelaide Hills, SA | 75 bottle | 18 glass
A lovely little number from the hills. Apple sherbet and stonefruit on the nose and palate, light and fresh. Medium dry. Refreshing and pretty, yet textural. 
2020 Poppelvej ØST | Adelaide Hills, SA | 85 bottle
Cloudy pear juice to the eye, bursting with crispy dry lemon juice and chamomile on the nose and palate. Grippy from 3 weeks on skins. An undertone of caramel. Complex and delicious in moderation. 

2017 Loosen-Barry Wolta Wolta  | Clare Valley, SA | 180 bottle 
A marriage of ‘royal’ families; the Barry’s from Clare and the Loosen’s from Mosel in Germany. The result? A spectacular example of Clare Riesling. Ripe lime and white nectarine on the nose and palate, fine texture and complex. 

2007 Clos Clare Museum Release  | Clare Valley, SA | 90 bottle 
Rich lime skins and lanolin on the nose, a toasted nuttiness even. Soft lime cordial and slight floral tones on the palate. Remarkably fresh for its age, but that says a lot for the makers and the vineyard. 

2018 Frankland Estate Alter Weg  | Frankland River, WA | 80 bottle  
Alter Weg = The Old Way. Barrel ferment dry riesling from Frankland River WA. Tight acidity matched by a food friendly palate weight. Delicious and complex. 

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. An aged beauty. 

2020 La Violetta Das Sakrileg  | Great Southern, WA | 85 bottle 
Nose like a scrumpy apple cider; baked apple and spice with interesting floral blossom pops. A delight to drink, medium-dry palate with more of that apple, with citrus tones and a lush, silky texture. Barrel ferment, unfined, 
2020 Mac Forbes RS22  | Strathbogie Ranges, Vic | 85 bottle  
Fermented in oak, 22g/l residual, ph 3.04. The back label is full of stats. What it doesn’t say is that this wine is effing delicious! Depths of minerals and earthy tones on the nose, medium palate weight. A delicate balance between the sugar, acidity and oak influences. Beautifully reminiscent of the best of Alsace. 

2019 Whistle and Hope | Wangaratta, Vic | 65 bottle 
Matt Kilby does one thing; make Riesling. Therefore the love and care he has for it shows up in the glass; a deliciously balanced, clean Riz with citrus drive and soft floral, herby notes on the nose.  

2015 Bream Creek Cellar Reserve  | East Coast, Tas | 85 bottle
About an hour north of Hobart sits Bream Creek. Established in the 70s and growing Riesling since. lush stonefruit and citrus, big viscous palate. 
2017 Pressing Matters R9  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 85 bottle
Medium dry and just phenomenally drinkable. Touch of age goes almost unnoticed. Slippery, silky, balanced. Tropical fruit tangoes with crisp citrus and the dabble of residual. Yummo. 
International Rieslings
The old world gets pretty worked up about who ‘owns’ Riesling. The Germans, the Austrians, the French. For us: who cares? Just drink the stuff. 

2019 Donnhoff | Nahe, Germany | 75 bottle 
Soft and rounded nose, slightly floral, slightly sweet, with tropical fruit and pear on the palate. Light spritz. Great value German off-dry Rizla.

2019 Loosen Dr. L  | Mosel, Germany | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Charred pineapple and subtle lychee on the nose. Vibrant palate with tight acidity and sweet tropical fruit. Balanced and extremely smashable. Bargain. Not the Mosel of old, thankfully. 

2018 Angsar Clusserath Apotheke  Spatlese | Mosel, Germany | 125 bottle
Ripened apple, grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose with a layer of floral and menthol notes. Palate of juicy fruit, fine acidity, long finish. Super. 

2014 Gunderloch Rothenberg  GG  | Rheinhessen, Germany | 300 bottle 
From a site reminiscent of Coonawarra’s terra rossa, producing this elegant and intense pink grapefruit and spice character. Incredible network of secondary flavours, minerals and spice. Super special and complex.  

2019 Robert Weil Kiedrich Grafenberg  GG  | Rheingau, Germany | 280 bottle
From a site classified as GG or equivalent since the 1860s. Super fine and intense dry example with pure pink grapefruit, lemon and white stonefruit. Crazy long and slightly savoury finish.  

2018 A Christmann IDIG  GG | Pfalz, Germany | 250 bottle 
Spice, herb and tropical fruit on the nose, then hitting the lemon curd/apple spectrum that’s a bit more familiar to an Aussie palate. Powerful, intense finish. 

2020 Emmerich Knoll Ried Loibenberg  | Wachau, Austria | 110 bottle  
Yellow grapefruit and white stonefruit on the nose and palate. A tinge of juicy citrus acidity. Long finish, clean and almost silky dry Austrian Riz. 

2016 Groiss Ried Auf Der Henne  Reserve  |  Weinviertel, Austria  |  150 bottle  
White blossoms and stonefruit on the nose and palate. A nip of residual but well balanced. 12hr maceration on skins and and 10 months on lees means there is serious texture and volume. Complex. Brilliant. Take your time.  

2019 Paul Blanck | Alsace, France | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Beautifully ripe pineapple, grapefruit and honeydew on the nose. Well balanced on the palate with acid and sugar tingling the senses and a distinct Alsace minerality lingering finish. Impressive and good value for imported. 

2017 Domaine Ostertag Muenchberg Grand Cru  | Alsace, France | 170  bottle
Apricots and peaches, with a well integrated spice and a hint of saline. This Grand Cru block was first planted in the 12th Century by Cistercian monks. 

2019 Rippon Juenesse  | Central Otago, New Zealand | 90 bottle 
Described as ‘like a child’s crayon drawing; vibrant, spirited, endearing’. We don’t know what that means, but the wine is seriously drinkable; well balanced, clean citrus, a touch of residual for funsies. Yummo.  


Tim’s Page
Who is Tim? Tim is your mate. You know? The fella with discerning taste, loves dry wines with a bit of a backstory or a bit of age on them. Or both. He’s keen for a chat, and knows heaps more about wine than Andy. So here’s to you Tim – enjoy some speccy’s ordered in with you in mind.

2014 Lark Hill Estate  back-vintage | Bungendore | 130 bottle  
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. A veritable bevvy of citrus on the palate. Great length. Wildly enjoyable. Biodynamic.  

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. We also have some of the 2008 Premium hanging about, not cold though. 

2007 Clos Clare Museum Release | Clare Valley, SA | 90 bottle 
Rich lime skins and lanolin on the nose, a toasted nuttiness even. Soft lime cordial and slight floral tones on the palate. Remarkably fresh for its age, but that says a lot for the makers and the vineyard. 

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. An aged beauty. 

2014 Gunderloch Rothenberg  GG  | Rheinhessen, Germany | 300 bottle 
From a site reminiscent of Coonawarra’s terra rossa, producing this elegant and intense pink grapefruit and spice character. Incredible network of secondary flavours, minerals and spice. Super special and complex.  

2016 Brundlmeyer Terrassen | Kamptal, Austria | 115 bottle  
From selected terrace vineyards of the estate. You know how long-lived Brundlmeyer Rieslings are, and as this one was made in a youthful style its hitting its straps between lively fruit and acid and mature body. Not kept cold. 

2014 Eden Road 94 Block  Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 90 bottle 
Shiraz exclusively from the Eden Road home block a few clicks south of Murrumbateman. Pristine quality fruit, all red and blue, light Sichuan pepper through the palate. Fine french oak is evident. Phenomenal length and finish. 


This is for the F‘n’G’s 
The imitators of, and close friends to, Riesling

2019 Long Rail Gully Pinot Gris | Murrumbateman, CBR | 60 bottle 
Bright pear and sweet apple, juicy, little bit of spice and white pepper, Great mouthfeel. Smashable booze by the folks at Long Rail Gully.  

2018 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 130 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak and in bottle, a real thinker’s white. Pioneers here in Canberra and recognized as one of the country’s best GV producers.

2021 Linear Fiano | Hilltops, NSW | 65 bottle 
Fresh pressed Packham pear juice, granny smiths and a light white pepper element to this super dry, lively and fresh white from Young NSW. Easily confused for a lively CBR riz quite frankly… 

2020 Hahndorf Hill Gru  Gruner Veltliner | Adelaide Hills, SA | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Citrus, nectarine and spice on the nose; stonefruit and grapefruit on the palate finished by a long mineral finish with a bit of texture. Highly acclaimed and great value Aussie Gruner. 

Worthy & worldly Whites
2014 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. You’d have no idea its 7-years old, still as fresh as tomorrow. 

2015 L.A.S Vino CBDB  | Margaret River, WA | 120 bottle 
100% chenin blanc from Margaret River is given the full treatment; wild yeast ferment, French barriques and clay amphora, lees stirring. The result is a textured, layered wine with a tonne of character and integrated fruit from grapefruit to lime and passionfruit. Awesome. 

2019 Fraser Gallop Parterre  Chardonnay | Margaret River, WA | 90 bottle 
Refined and balanced. Fine acid, its not until the mid palate that you realise it is Chardy, and it is gooood chardy. Barrel fermented. Total Margaret River elegance. 

2018 Indigo Alpine Vineyards  Chardonnay | Beechworth, Vic | 80 bottle | 19 glass
A Yellowy green in the glass, ripe but refined nose of stonefruit and oak. Complex, refined, excellent rendition of Beechworth Chardy. Will continue to develop over time and get deeper as it goes. 

2020 Mada Wines Sui Generis VI  Vermentino  | Riverlands, SA | 80 bottle 
Skin contact Vermentino by Hamish young, grown under organic practices by Ash Ratcliff at Ricca Terrra. 6 weeks on skins so no doubt about a textural hit to start but delightfully lush mouthfeel, primary fruits of spiced apricot and almond. Very clean lo-fi wine. Hip, but not too hip. 





The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

2021 Gilbert Pet-nat Riesling | Orange, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Crispy and minimal funk. Cloudy apple cider to the eye, green apple and lime on the nose and palate, mouth-filling fizz. Delicious. GT Young Winemaker of the Year 2021. 

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles. Simple, clean, balanced. 

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Nature  | Champagne, Fra | 180 bottle 
A new one to their impressive stable. For me its like a cross with my other fave; Bolly. Its richer in style than the cristal clear intensity of the above, more honey’on’toast and brioche, nutty notes. An absolute killer. 


Rose 
Pretty, pretty dry, and pretty good with arvo sunshine

2021 Mount Majura Rosado | Majura, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
100% Graciano from new plantings. Pale in the glass, redcurrant and melon on the nose,  and then this lovely spiced red fruit and pink grapefruit palate with hints of white pepper. Dry, with a lovely clean texture. 

2020 Domaine Saint-Marie | Provence, France | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Classic Provence style rose. Grenache based. Dry and super pretty, strawberries and cream with secondary raspberry and watermelon on the palate. An absolute belter in the sun.

2020 Vinden & Gilbert Lignee  Rose | Central Ranges, NSW | 110 magnum
Countless varietals, thrice as many ferments. Some serious effort put in to this gem of a rose. Aromatic, dry, textural and fun. Enjoyable and just hip enough to make it in Braddon. 




A Concise list of Reds
Listed lightest to heaviest, kinda

2019 Linear Pinot Noir | Tumbarumba, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass 
Distinct deep fleshy red cherry on the nose with a hint of savouriness. Cherry and red plum again on the palate, with a complex of smoky nuttiness. Super fine tannin. Well balanced.  

2017 Pressing Matters Pinot Noir | Coal River Valley, Tas | 170 bottle
Pressing Matters does Riesling and Pinot Noir. That’s all. And they’re damn good at them. Light in the glass, Red and dark cherry on the palate, super fine tannin. Sweet then a slight savoury and earthy finish. Intriguing Pinot.

2018 Freeman Altura Vineyard Nebbiolo | Hilltops, NSW | 75 bottle | 18 glass 
Epitome of pretty. Medium dry red from Young, NSW with plenty to like about it; black cherry and spiced fruitcake on the nose, fine grip through the palate with plenty of yummy fruit character. Truly delicious. 

2017 Sholto Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
A very pretty and light expression of CBR Razla. Red fruit, spice and Sichuan on the nose with a slight smoked meat  character.  Delectable soft fruit and fine tannin on the palate. Really enjoyable light dry red. 

2019 Long Rail Gully Shiraz | Murrumbateman, CBR | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Red berries, spice and liquorice on the nose, light and juicy on the palate; red fruit turning to dark cherry and blood plum through the palate. Allrounder.  

2014 Eden Road 94 Block  Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 90 bottle 
Shiraz exclusively from the Eden Road home block a few clicks south of Murrumbateman. Pristine quality fruit, all red and blue, light Sichuan pepper through the palate. Fine french oak is evident. Phenomenal length and finish. 

2018 Te Mata Bullnose  Syrah | Hawke’s Bay, NZ | 140 bottle 
An Iconic Syrah from a single vineyard in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand. Perfume and spice on the nose, richly blue + red fruits galore, and a fine silky finish. 

2016 Grove Estate Shiraz Viognier | Hilltops, NSW | 75 bottle 
A bargain SV from near Young NSW. Perfumed nose as is to be expected, medium weighted fruit, well balanced between the light perfume and dense red fruit characters. Has benefited and softened from a few years in bottle. 

2016 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 260 bottle 
The Ron Burgundy of Canberra reds; it’s kind of a big deal. Great vintage of a super wine; elegant, perfumed, precise, medium-bodied. Simply a great wine and a main reason behind Clonakilla being the flagship of Murrumbateman. 

2005 Grant Burge Filsell  Shiraz | Barossa Valley, SA | 175 bottle 
An Icon. Great value Barossa Shiraz in its youth, but you’re welcome for my patience; I’ve been holding on to this for more than a decade waiting for the right moment. Liquorice, vanilla and spice, dark choc, fine tannins, rich fruit. 

2016 Indigo Hannahford  Cabernet Blend | Beechworth, Vic | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Deep reddish with slight bricking to the eye means its good to go. Ooooh gee that’s a nice nose. Cassis and raspberry and fine tannins on the palate, good grip on the mid palate without being chewy. 
Big Format
For when the party strikes and its time to ball. Ball hard.  

Bubbles, Whites & Rose
NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 

2019 Koehler-Ruprecht Kallstadter  Riesling | Pfalz, Germany | 165 magnum
Trocken by designation and made the traditional Pfalz way; spontaneous barrel ferment, lees for 9 months, and bottled just before next vintage comes in. Melon and citrus on the nose, lively acidity. Good value maggie. 

2017 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  Riesling  | Frankland River, WA | 210 magnum
Another one of our all-time fave aussie riesling producers. Super dry, a lot of similarities to a CBR dry Riesling; minerally, lime and lemon juice, purity of fruit and a long, long finish. 

2018 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett | Mosel, Germany | 380 magnum 
Deep white fruit, quince and packed to the brim with blossom on the nose with distinct slateyness and the typical kabinett pang of sugar and acidity. Elegant as all Prums, and ageing gracefully.  

2020 Vinden & Gilbert Lignee  Rose | Central Ranges, NSW | 110 magnum
Countless varietals, thrice as many ferments. Some serious effort put in to this gem of a rose. Aromatic, dry, textural and fun. Enjoyable and just hip enough to make it in Braddon. 

Reds 
2010 Hans Herzog Pinot Noir | Marlborough, NZ | 280 magnum 
Marlborough exists in no small part due to Hans Herzog.. Supreme quality fruit, all handpicked. Dark cherry and raspberry, complex and fine, with a hint of spiced fruit cake underneath all that primary fruit. Unfined, unfiltered, hazy. 

2019 Ravensworth Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 260 magnum
In one word? Super. Super floral and brambly nose. Super red fruit and white pepper on the palate. Super use of fine European oak equals super fine tannins and a super finish. Like I said, just super. Bottles also available

2020 Vanguardist V  Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 625 jeraboam  
Graceful Grenache from the ‘silver sands’ vineyard at Blewitt Springs. Light ruby, slight haze, layered nose of red and blue berries, olive and oregano. Lots of concentrated red berry characters, anise, spice  and defined structure. Fine oak use. Medium weight, dry, phenomenal length. Really, really good wine.   

1994 Wynns John Riddoch  Cabernet Sauvignon | Coonawarra, SA | 600 magnum  
Peerless, and the first Aussie wine to create a buzz livestreaming style, well before the internet and insta. Quite a remarkable wine in its youth, but as it ages it becomes silky, the darker-than-cassis palate softening only slightly with layers of leather and a silky palate. Quite remarkable. 


Dessert style Rieslings 
From beautifully light, to thick and rich, sweet style Rieslings can do anything! Listed here from least to most residual sugar.

2019 Lark Hill Ley-Line  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Pale yellow, medium-bodied sticky with zingy acidity and beautiful ripe pineapple palate.

2020 Frogmore Creek Iced Riesling  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2021 Mount Horrocks Cordon Cut  | Clare Valley, SA | 90 bottle
Dense and concentrated thanks to the cane-cut process. Juicy citrus, spring florals and spice. Impressively sweet and long, yet acidity prevents cloy. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish. 

2017 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 150 bottle
Dense and concentrated. Raisin and crispy citrus on the nose give way to stonefruit and white cherry on the palate. Incredible booze. Still has a zippy acid backbone underneath all that fleshy goodness.
