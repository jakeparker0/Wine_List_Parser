We’re all about the Riesling. 
Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some forgotten relatives of Riesling, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the queen of grapes and its ability to go with pretty well any cuisine.  
Canberra Riesling has come a looooong way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 
Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!
Cheers,
Andy Day
