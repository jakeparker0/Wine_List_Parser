We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some forgotten relatives of Riesling, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 

Hall - 25km North West

2019 Nick O’Leary Heywood  | 75 bottle 
Exceptional value single-site Riesling. Citrus and hints of crisp green melon. Perfect with fresh oysters and seafood or use it to cut through fatty fried foods. 

2018 Brindabella Hills | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Classic Canberra Riesling from the hills overlooking the Murrumbidgee about 35kms WNW of Canberra. Dry with heaps of citrus on the nose and palate. Great clean finish.


Murrumbateman | Jeir – 35km to 45km NNW

2018 Yarrh | 50 bottle | 12 glass
Sharp citrus and minerality. Dry, light and moorish. Great value classic Canberra style Riesling from just north of Murrumbateman. 

2018 Clonakilla | 80 bottle 
Power and precision, like all Clonakilla wines. Buckets of lime, super tight acidity and it just keeps going and going…

2018 Ravensworth Estate  | 75 bottle
A more complex creation; a good bit of texture, from ceramic egg fermentation, but still lets the fruit shine. Layered; a real thinkers Rizla. 

2018 Helm Half Dry  | 55 bottle | 13 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.

2018 Helm Premium  | 85 bottle
Brilliantly concentrated citrus and crunchy apple. Absolutely mouthwatering intensity. A benchmark of the Australian Riesling scene. 

2019 Poachers Pantry | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Fresh acidity, loads of limes and nice floral notes. Makes the palate salivate. Good wine, good young winemaker. 
2019 Four Winds | 60 bottle 
An off-dry style; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from an excellent producer. 

2018 Mada | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Dry, clean, light style Canberra Riesling. Really good acidity and nice subtle floral notes to go with the typical Canberra citrus and minerality. Good booze. 
2018 Gallagher | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Already showing signs of ageing; lemon curd, mandarin, honey, minerality. Superbly balanced, great finish. Clapping emoji.


Bungendore | Collector | Lake George | CBR - doorstep to 30km ENE + 50KM NNE

2018 Nick O’Leary White Rocks  | 85 bottle
This will be spoken about in revered tones in years to come; a brilliant wine showing the intensity and balance of great Canberra Rieslings. Taken from the Lake George Winery site on the edge of Lake George. Jump on and enjoy the ride. 

2019 Mount Majura | 65 bottle 
Juicy lemon palate with a long steely finish. Superbly balanced and quintessentially Canberran. Reliably great Riesling year in, year out. 

2019 Lake George Winery Ryder  | 55 bottle | 13 glass
P O W E R. Super intense lime juice palate with searing acidity. One for the hardened fans of dry Riesling, and definitely has the bones to age well. 

2019 Sapling Yard Bungendore  | 65 bottle 
Lush floral nose followed by racy acidity and effervescence on the front palate. Good balance and tight minerality. Good long finish. Winemaker Carla Rodeghiero is also vigneron, picker and delivery driver – talk about a one-woman show!
2014 Lark Hill back-vintage  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 80 bottle
A cracker year, great producer, classic Canberra Rizla with citrus and now an added complexity from age. 



The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 13 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2017 Wallaroo Sparkling Riesling | Hall, CBR | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Mouthfillng fizz, refreshing lemon on the palate with acid and sugar in great balance. Long finish with great texture. Highly enjoyable. 

2019 Ravensworth Ancestral  Riesling | Murrumbateman, CBR | 70 bottle 
Crisp green apple, sherbet lemon drops. Lightly sparkling, super cloudy pet nat, good grip and texture. Perfect with slightly richer food. 

2019 Gilbert Pet Nat Riesling | Orange, NSW | 65 bottle 
Mouthfilling dry fizz with a restrained citrus nose. Very approachable, borderline smashable. Made by up-and-coming winemaker Will Gilbert from Mudgee – watch this space.

2011 Lark Hill Chardonnay Pinot Noir | Bungendore, Canberra District | 110 bottle 
Probably the best vintage sparkling from mainland Aus, in our humble opinion. Comparable to your generous champagne styles; biscuits, honey, and crisp acidity. Yum.



Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2019 Grosset Polish Hill  | Clare Valley, SA | 230 magnum 
THE definitive Clare; bone dry, intense citrus and cool slate with a persistent finish. Everything tastes better from a magnum. 

2018 Mount Horrocks Watervale  | Clare Valley, SA | 80 bottle 
Kaffir lime, apple and lemon on the palate. Another precise example from the Clare. 

2018 Vanguardist | Clare Valley, SA | 85 bottle 
Judging this book by its cover it’s a solid 10; cloth label, wax-dipped cork. Beauty. What’s inside is just as good; extended time on skins and a variety of fermentation techniques creates layers of complex citrus and apple but in no way hiding the brightness of Clare. My new fave from SA.

2019 Chaffey Bros. Not your Grandma’s  | Eden Valley, SA | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Dry, with a spritzy acidity, great mouthfeel, lively, lots of citrus. Simply lovely.

2008 Pikes Merle  | Clare Valley, SA | 120 bottle 
An aged edge to the classic Clare characteristics of minerality and citrus. One of Australia’s premier Rieslings, held back for your drinking pleasure.  

2012 Crawford River | Henty, Vic | 185 bottle 
Mainland Australia’s foremost Riesling producer. Supreme ageability from super their site planted in the 1970’s in Henty. Still a youthful green, very delicate with soft floral notes on the nose, apple skins and a hint of white peach on the palate. Acidity has barely softened and this wine still has a good two decades in it yet. 

2018 Robert Stein Half Dry  | Mudgee, NSW | 70 bottle 
A medium-dry Riesling with plenty of Lime notes and a good whack of residual sugar. Hot producer, all their wines are top notch. 

2018 Colmar Block 6  | Orange, NSW | 70 bottle
Phenomenal drinking right now, clean green apples, lemon, mandarin peel and minerality. The critics are all on this at the moment. 

2018 Stefano Lubiana | Derwent Valley, Tas | 80 bottle
Deliciously light citrus, with a good mouthfeel coming from some time in old oak. Very good booze. Tassie wines, so hot right now, Tassie wines…

2018 Harewood Estate Porongurup  | Great Southern, WA | 75 bottle 
Apple blossom, loads of lemon and mineral intensity with an incredible, long finish. A rising star of WA.

2018 Frankland River Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 75 bottle
Very clean and very dry, crisp granny smith on the palate with zippy acidity and good tight finish. 



Beautiful old girls
Aged Rieslings; a ‘gift that keeps on giving,’ as cousin Eddie would say..

2014 Lark Hill back-vintage  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 80 bottle
A cracker year, great producer, classic Canberra Rizla with citrus and now an added complexity from age. 

2008 Pikes Merle  | Clare Valley, SA | 125 bottle 
An aged edge to the classic Clare characteristics of minerality and citrus. One of Australia’s premier Rieslings, held back for your drinking pleasure.  

2009 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 85 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser has made a brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2009 was a slightly warmer year, creating a Riesling with white peach, floral and citrus notes with a bit of sweetness to balance the acidity. 


International Rieslings
The Georgians started it, the Austrians fervently claim it, the Germans own it

2017 Donnhoff | Nahe, Germany | 80 bottle 
Soft and rounded, slightly sweet, with tropical fruit and pear on the palate. Great value German off-dry Rizla.

2015 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 280 magnum
White fruit, quince and flowers on the nose with distinct slateyness. Sweet and juicy but with a great acid structure. One of the best, from one of the best. 

2017 Dr Loosen Wehlener Sonnenuhr Trocken GG | Mosel, Germany | 165 bottle 
Light and spritzy tropical fruit on the palate, a truly top tier ‘grand cru’ German. A persistent and delicate, pretty Riesling. Simply delicious. 

2016 Brundlmeyer Terrassen | Kamptal, Austria | 95 bottle
Complex, with early signs of ageing yet very light and clean palate. Grapefruit and sweet lemon on the palate with a wet stone minerality. Goood.

2016 Domaine Weinbach Cuvee Colette | Alsace, France | 200 bottle
Racy, dry and spicy. Super dry for Alsace. Mixed citrus and white pepper notes. Super old vines, mainly from the famed Schlossberg vineyard but missing the Grand Cru classification. One of the French greats. 

2016 Willm Reserve  | Alsace, France | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Beautifully ripe, lush nose with honey and floral notes followed by a well-balanced delivery of fruit and tight acidity. Absolute bargain frenchy. 

2018 Rippon Juenesse  | Central Otago, New Zealand | 90 bottle
A precise and light Riesling from young vines. Described as ‘like a child’s crayon drawing; vibrant, spirited, endearing’. We don’t know what that means, but the wine is seriously drinkable; well balanced, clean citrus. Yum. 

2009 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 85 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser has made a brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. Tasting notes up in the old girls. 

This is for the G’s 
The imitators, the long lost cousins of Riesling

2018 Long Rail Gully Pinot Gris | Murrumbateman, CBR | 55 bottle 
Bright pear and sweet apple, juicy, little bit of spice and white pepper, Great mouthfeel. Smashable booze by the folks at Long Rail Gully.  

2018 Mount Majura Pinot Gris | Majura, Canberra District | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Dry style gris from just up the road; Stonefruit and pear juice with very subtle spice. Highly smashable. 

2018 Villa Wolf Gewurztraminer | Pfalz, Germany | 50 bottle | 12 glass
Typically bright lychee and spice on the nose, light rose petal, good mouthfeel, fresh and clean. Dry style gewurtz = good times.

2017 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 85 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak, a real thinker’s white. 

2018 Nick Spencer Gruner Veltliner | Tumbarumba, NSW | 60 bottle
Green apple and grapefruit with subtle white pepper on the palate and tight acidity. 

2018 Suavia Classico Soave  | Veneto, Italy | 70 bottle
Buckets of citrus, balanced acidity and an unmistakably fresh Garganega character. Top notch Italian white, their own answer to Riesling.  


Worthy & worldly Whites
2012 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. 

2018 Vinden Estate Verdelho | Hunter Valley, NSW | 50 bottle | 12 glass 	
Ripe tropical fruit, medium-bodied, tight acidity. None of that chalky texture that plagues this Portuguese workhorse. 

2018 Campuget 1753 Viognier | Rhone Valley, France | 65 bottle
Fresh apricot, almond and spice, a clean and dry style Viognier. 

2018 Langlois-Chateau Chenin Blanc | Loire Valley, France | 60 bottle
Apple and lemon on the palate, tiny hint of honey on the nose, dry and generous. 

2018 Dawning Day Chardonnay | Southern Highlands, NSW | 75 bottle | 17 glass
Partial wild ferment, 30% new oak, malolactic fermentation, whole bunch press, weekly lees stirring. Grapefruit and rockmelon on the palate. Delicious, with enough for every Chardonnay drinker.

2018 Nick Spencer Chardonnay | Tumbarumba, NSW | 70 bottle 
A pretty full-bodied expression from the Marangle vineyard, matured in French oak puncheons for structure and balance adding to the stonefruit and citrus palate. 


A concise list of Red Wines


2018 Poachers Pinot Noir | Murrumbateman, CBR | 60 bottle | 14 glass
A good Pinot from Canberra? Surely you jest! Will Bruce has very humbly produced a cracker from a cool easterly aspect site; using 25% new oak barrels the 2018 has a vibrant nose of cherry, with spice and plum on the palate. Good structure deliciously light.

2018 Long Rail Gully FMG Gamay | Murrumbateman, CBR | 80 bottle | 18 glass
Perfumed nose, light palate, silky mouthfeel and just a hint of spice. A very approachable gamay with minimal funk or fuss, great with pepper pig loin. 

2016 Koehler-Ruprecht Pinot Noir | Pfalz, Germany | 75 bottle
Pretty pinot from Pfalz. A bright nose, light palate, yet smoky and good dark cherry. Total surprise packet.

2016 Fighting Gully Road Sangiovese | Beechworth, Vic | 80 bottle

2016 Hahndorf Hill Blueblood Blaufranckisch | Adelaide Hills, SA | 90 bottle
‘Pinot with stubble’. Copious blue fruits and cherry on the palate with a distinct spice element. Australians doing Austrian stuff very, very well. 

2017 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, Canberra District | 210 bottle 
The Ron Burgundy of Canberra reds; it’s kind of a big deal. Super vintage of a super wine; elegant, perfumed, precise, medium-bodied. Simply a great wine. 

2017 Mckellar Ridge SV | Murrumbateman, Canberra District | 70 bottle | 16 glass
Beautiful and great value Shiraz Viognier. Light magenta in the glass, perfumed, red fruit on the nose, good tannins. Bright and super light palate weight.

2018 Mount Majura Mondeuse | Majura, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 14 glass
Spicy dark fruit on the palate, juicy and vibrant. Great value medium-bodied booze.

2008 Torbreck The Pict Mataro | Barossa Valley, SA | 250 magnum 
Mulberry and dried plums, with that mataro spice fruit cake love. Full-bodied, structured, good tannins, they did good for a heatwave year. A big wine in a big bottle. 

2017 Fraser Gallop Palladian Cabernet Sauvignon | Margaret River, WA | 160 bottle
Leads with an intense nose of blackcurrant and violet, leading in to a concentrated and elegant palate. Phenomenal tannins and texture. Perfect Margaret River Cab Sauv.


Dessert style Rieslings

Pale yellow, medium-bodied sticky with zingy acidity and beautiful ripe pineapple palate.

2019 Frogmore Creek Iced Riesling  | Cambridge, Tas | 60 bottle
Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2017 Framingham F-series Beerenauslese  | Marlborough, NZ | 120 bottle
Incredibly sweet and rich with slatherings of candied pineapple and dried apricot. 

2016 Framingham F-seriesTrockenbeerenauslese  | Marlborough, NZ | 170 bottle
Imagine a big bowl of apricots covered in honey, spices and drizzled caramel. Then liquify it. Supreme intensity, sweetness and balanced by acidity. Top stuff. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish.
