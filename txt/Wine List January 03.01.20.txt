We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some Riesling impersonators, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

2018 Nick O’Leary Heywood  | 80 bottle 
Exceptional value single-site Riesling from Nick’s home plot. Citrus and hints of crisp green melon. Well balanced acidity. Classic Nick.  


Murrumbateman | Jeir – 35km to 45km NNW

2018 Yarrh | 55 bottle | 13 glass
Sharp citrus and minerality. Dry, light and moorish. Great value classic Canberra style Riesling from just north of Murrumbateman. 

2019 Gallagher | 70 bottle | 16 glass
Bright lemon curd, mandarin, honey, minerality. Superbly balanced, great finish. Clapping emoji.

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a quintessentially steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2018 Ravensworth Estate  | 75 bottle
A more complex creation; a good bit of texture, from ceramic egg fermentation, but still lets the fruit shine. Layered; a real thinkers Rizla. 

2018 Helm Half Dry  | 55 bottle | 13 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.

2019 Poachers Pantry | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Fresh acidity, loads of limes and nice floral notes. Makes the palate salivate. Good wine, good young winemaker. 
2019 Sholto | 65 bottle | 15 glass
Floral nose, rich, sweetness taken back by clean acidity and tight texture. Orange, pear and mandarin on the palate. Dry finish. Interesting and very different for CBR Riesling. 

2018 Mada | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Dry, clean, light style Canberra Riesling. Really good acidity and nice subtle floral notes to go with the typical Canberra citrus and minerality. Good booze. 
2019 Gundog Estate | 85 bottle 
Juicy lime, balanced acidity and minerality, slight floral note on the nose. From the Four Winds vineyard. Phenomenal booze, and worth hiding a few bottles for a decade…




Bungendore | Collector | Lake George | CBR - doorstep to 30km ENE + 50KM NNE


2019 Mount Majura | 140 magnum | 65 bottle 
Juicy lemon palate with a long steely finish. Superbly balanced and quintessentially Canberran. Reliably great Riesling year in, year out. 

2019 Lark Hill Canberra Region  | 55 bottle 
Floral nose, zesty citrus on the palate. Bright and delicious. Mostly from the Freeman vineyard at Young, thus the ‘region’ and not ‘district’ tagline (but made at the home base at Bungendore). 




The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 13 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2017 Wallaroo Sparkling Riesling | Hall, CBR | 65 bottle | 15 glass
Mouthfillng fizz, refreshing lemon on the palate with acid and sugar in great balance. Long finish with great texture. Highly enjoyable. 

2019 Ravensworth Ancestral  Riesling | Murrumbateman, CBR | 70 bottle 
Crisp green apple, sherbet lemon drops. Lightly sparkling, super cloudy pet nat, good grip and texture. Perfect with slightly richer food. 

2011 Lark Hill Chardonnay Pinot Noir | Bungendore, Canberra District | 110 bottle 
Probably the best vintage sparkling from mainland Aus, in our humble opinion. Comparable to your generous champagne styles; biscuits, honey, and crisp acidity. Yum.

NV Jacquesson Cuvee 741  | Champagne, France | 175 bottle 
Full nose of bread and honey, a soft bead, citrus and melon palate, crisp finish. The French doing what the French do damn well. 


Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2019 Grosset Polish Hill  | Clare Valley, SA | 230 magnum 
THE definitive Clare; bone dry, intense citrus and cool slate with a persistent finish. Everything tastes better from a magnum. 

2018 Mount Horrocks Watervale  | Clare Valley, SA | 80 bottle | 18 glass
Kaffir lime, apple and lemon on the palate. Another precise example from the Clare. 

2018 Rieslingfreak No.8 Schatzkammer  | Clare Valley, SA | 80 bottle 
Forget what you think you thought you knew about Clare Riesling and best pretend you’re drinking a German kabinett instead! Delicious, delicate, finely balanced sugar and acid. Lively as hell. 6%ABV. An absolute knockout wine.

2019 Chaffey Bros. Not your Grandma’s  | Eden Valley, SA | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Dry, with a spritzy acidity, great mouthfeel, lively, lots of citrus. Simply lovely.

2019 Clos Clare | Clare Valley, SA | 75 bottle 
What would the Barry family know about Riesling? Everything. From a patch adjoining the famour ‘Florita’ vineyard comes this elegant classic. Lemon and lime on the nose, balanced citrus and acidity throughout the palate. Another beauty and a bargain. 

2019 Vinteloper | Clare Valley, SA | 65 bottle
Subtle nose of Slate and lemon juice. Floral mid palate and a dry finish creating an irresistible salavating effect. Winner.

2019 Ashton Hills Estate   | Adelaide Hills, SA | 80 bottle 
Clean zippy example from one of the Hills’ finest producers of any and all things. Plenty of lemon juice and floral notes.

2012 Crawford River | Henty, Vic | 185 bottle 
Mainland Australia’s foremost Riesling producer. Supreme ageability from super their site planted in the 1970’s in Henty. Still a youthful green, very delicate with soft floral notes on the nose, apple skins and a hint of white peach on the palate. Acidity has barely softened and this wine still has a good two decades in it yet. 

2018 Colmar Block 6  | Orange, NSW | 70 bottle
Phenomenal drinking right now, clean green apples, lemon, mandarin peel and minerality. The critics are all on this at the moment. 

2018 Stefano Lubiana | Derwent Valley, Tas | 80 bottle
Deliciously light citrus, with a good mouthfeel coming from some time in old oak. Very good booze. Tassie wines, so hot right now, Tassie wines…

2018 Harewood Estate Porongurup  | Great Southern, WA | 75 bottle 
Apple blossom, loads of lemon and mineral intensity with an incredible, long finish. A rising star of WA.

2018 Frankland River Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 75 bottle
Very clean and very dry, crisp granny smith on the palate with zippy acidity and good tight finish. 

Beautiful old girls
Aged Rieslings; a ‘gift that keeps on giving,’ as cousin Eddie would say..

2012 Crawford River | Henty, Vic | 185 bottle 
Still a youthful green, very delicate with soft floral notes on the nose, apple skins and a hint of white peach on the palate. Acidity has barely softened and this wine still has a good two decades in it yet. 

2008 Stadt Krems Grillenparz  | Kremstal, Austria | 150 bottle
A plush, generous Riesling, plenty of rich creamy notes of ripe pear, apple and white peach, finishing with baked goods and spice. From a vineyard dating back to 1180. Age has given layers of complexity.
	
2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a quintessentially steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 


International Rieslings
The Austrians & Germans fervently claim it as their own… cute says the French. 

2017 Donnhoff | Nahe, Germany | 80 bottle | 18 glass 
Soft and rounded, slightly sweet, with tropical fruit and pear on the palate. Great value German off-dry Rizla.

2017 Dr Loosen Wehlener Sonnenuhr Trocken GG | Mosel, Germany | 165 bottle 
Light and spritzy tropical fruit on the palate, a truly top tier ‘grand cru’ German. A persistent and delicate, pretty Riesling. Simply delicious. 

2008 Stadt Krems Grillenparz  | Kremstal, Austria | 150 bottle
A plush, generous Riesling, plenty of rich creamy notes of ripe pear, apple and white peach, finishing with baked goods and spice. 

2012 Domaine Paul Blanck Schlossberg  Grand Cru | Alsace, France | 125 bottle
Minerality, lemon and aromas of white flowers, nectarine and tangerine. Richer on the palate than the nose would suggest; creamy tropical fruit and floral flavours lingering smoothly on the aftertaste. 

2016 Domaine Weinbach Cuvee Colette | Alsace, France | 200 bottle
Racy, dry and spicy. Super dry for Alsace. Mixed citrus and white pepper notes. Super old vines, mainly from the famed Schlossberg vineyard but missing the Grand Cru classification. One of the French greats. 

2016 Willm Reserve  | Alsace, France | 70 bottle | 17 glass 
Beautifully ripe, lush nose with honey and floral notes followed by a well-balanced delivery of fruit and tight acidity. Absolute bargain frenchy. 

2018 Rippon Juenesse  | Central Otago, New Zealand | 90 bottle
Described as ‘like a child’s crayon drawing; vibrant, spirited, endearing’. We don’t know what that means, but the wine is seriously drinkable; well balanced, clean citrus, light and minerally. Yum. 

This is for the G’s 
The imitators, the long lost cousins of Riesling

2019 BK Wines Pinot Grigio | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle 
Approachable and delicious. Plenty of fresh crunchy pear and apple on the palate and a refreshing acidity. 

2018 Mount Majura Pinot Gris | Majura, Canberra District | 60 bottle | 14 glass
Dry style gris from just up the road; Stonefruit and pear juice with very subtle spice. Highly smashable. 

2018 Villa Wolf Gewurztraminer | Pfalz, Germany | 50 bottle | 12 glass
Typically bright lychee and spice on the nose, light rose petal, good mouthfeel, fresh and clean. Dry style gewurtz = good times.

2017 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 85 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak, a real thinker’s white. 

2018 Hahndorf Hill GRU  Gruner Veltliner | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle
Citrus, nectarine and spice on the nose; stonefruit and grapefruit on the palate finished by a long mineral finish with a bit of texture. 

2018 Suavia Classico Soave  | Veneto, Italy | 70 bottle
Buckets of citrus, balanced acidity and an unmistakably fresh Garganega character. Top notch Italian white, their own answer to Riesling.  


Worthy & worldly Whites
2012 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. 

2019 Sapling Yard The Four Pinots  | Boorowa & CBR | 65 bottle | 15 glass 	
Gris from Boorowa NSW, Noir from Murrumbateman, Meunier from Lake George, and Blanc from Braidwood create maybe the most interesting Pinot blend we’ve ever seen! Wild yeast ferment, some stainless, some oak. Dry and textural, tight acidity, then lush red fruit and pear juice. Cool and different.

2018 Langlois-Chateau Chenin Blanc | Loire Valley, France | 65 bottle
Apple and lemon on the palate, tiny hint of honey on the nose, dry and generous. 

2016 Fighting Gully Road Chardonnay | Beechworth, Vic | 85 bottle | 20 glass
A generous chardonnay from a top vineyard from one of Australia’s top regions from one of Australia’s best wine makers Adrian Rodda. Wild ferment in French oak, a powerful balance between stonefruit and citrus characters and a super clean finish. Awesome Chard. 

2018 Nick Spencer Chardonnay | Tumbarumba, NSW | 70 bottle 
A pretty yet full-bodied expression from the Marangle vineyard, matured in French oak puncheons for structure and balance adding to the stonefruit and citrus palate. 
A concise list of Red Wines

2018 Long Rail Gully FMG  Gamay | Murrumbateman, CBR | 80 bottle 
Perfumed nose, light palate, silky mouthfeel and just a hint of spice. A very approachable gamay with minimal funk or fuss, great with pepper pig loin. 

2018 Poachers Pinot Noir | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle | 15 glass
A good Pinot from Canberra? Surely you jest! Will Bruce has very humbly produced a cracker from a cool easterly aspect site; using 25% new oak barrels the 2018 has a vibrant nose of cherry, with spice and plum on the palate. Good structure deliciously light.

2017 Pressing Matters Pinot Noir | Coal River Valley, Tas | 160 bottle
Pressing Matters does Riesling and Pinot Noir. That’s all. And they’re damn good at them. 2017 Pinot is winning a swathe of awards and rightly so; generous fruit, great structure and acidity. Dangerously drinkable. 

2016 Koehler-Ruprecht Pinot Noir | Pfalz, Germany | 75 bottle
Pretty pinot from Pfalz. A bright nose, light palate, yet smoky and good dark cherry. Total surprise packet.

2016 Fighting Gully Road Sangiovese | Beechworth, Vic | 80 bottle
Blackberry and a hint of olive on the palate, great mouthfeel and lingering finish. Superb light-medium red by Mark Walpole. 
 
2019 Unico Zelo Fresh A.F  Nero D’Avola | Riverland, SA | 55 bottle | 14 glass
The ultimate summer red?  Oh yeah!! Light, bright and fresh a.f indeed. Delicious red fruit, spicy mid palate and light tannins. Totally smashable. 

2018 Vanguardist Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 110 bottle
Graceful Grenache from the ‘silver sands’ vineyard at Blewitt Springs. Lots of concentrated red berry character, defined structure thanks to a solid acid backbone. Really very good wine.  

2017 Hahndorf Hill Blueblood  Blaufranckisch | Adelaide Hills, SA | 90 bottle
‘Pinot with stubble’. Copious blue fruits and cherry on the palate with a distinct spice element. Australians doing Austrian stuff very, very well. 

2017 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 210 bottle 
The Ron Burgundy of Canberra reds; it’s kind of a big deal. Super vintage of a super wine; elegant, perfumed, precise, medium-bodied. Simply a great wine. 

2017 McKellar Ridge Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 80 bottle | 18 glass
Perfumed and peppery nose, good red fruit on the front palate, supple tannins and lingering mouthfeel and finish. Really good value local SV. 

2018 Mount Majura Mondeuse | Majura, CBR | 55 bottle | 14 glass
Spicy dark fruit on the palate, juicy and vibrant. Great value medium-bodied booze.

2008 Torbreck The Pict  Mataro | Barossa Valley, SA | 250 magnum 
Mulberry and dried plums, with that mataro spice fruit cake love. Full-bodied, structured, good tannins, they did good for a heatwave year. A big wine in a big bottle. 



Dessert style Rieslings 
From beautifully light, to thick and rich, sweet style Rieslings can do anything! Listed here from least to most residual sugar.

2019 Lark Hill Ley-Line  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 65 bottle | 14 glass
Pale yellow, medium-bodied sticky with zingy acidity and beautiful ripe pineapple palate.

Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2017 Framingham F-series Beerenauslese  | Marlborough, NZ | 120 bottle
Incredibly sweet and rich with slatherings of candied pineapple and dried apricot. 

2016 Framingham F-seriesTrockenbeerenauslese  | Marlborough, NZ | 170 bottle
Imagine a big bowl of apricots covered in honey, spices and drizzled caramel. Then liquify it. Supreme intensity, sweetness and balanced by acidity. Top stuff. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish.
