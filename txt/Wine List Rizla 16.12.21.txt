We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some Riesling impersonators, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 
50-odd producers, 70-odd Rieslings in a vintage. This is just a list of highlights

2021 Mount Majura | Majura | 70 bottle 
Quintessential Canberra style; Juicy lime and lemon palate with secondary granny smith. Superbly balanced, dry and a long zingy finish. 

2019 Brindabella Hills | Hall | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Classic Canberra Riesling from the hills overlooking the Murrumbidgee about 35kms WNW of Canberra. Dry with heaps of citrus on the nose and palate. 

2021 Nick O’Leary Heywood  | Hall | 75 bottle  
Exceptional value single-site Riesling from Nick’s home plot. Citrus and hints of crisp green melon. Well balanced acidity. Classic Nick.   

2021 Sapling Yard Lake George  | Lake George | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Utterly delicious. One of our new faves. Why? It’s got a delicate citrus nose like a classic CBR Riz, fresh cut tart green apple, soft lime and subtle spice on the palate. There’s balance, superb length and a silky mouthfeel. Snaps for Sapling. 

2021 Long Rail Gully | Murrumbateman | 60 bottle | 15 glass
A light and aromatic style, with a hint of stone fruit on the nose and fresh lime juice on the palate. A sharp clean finish.

2011 Eden Road | Murrumbateman | 125 bottle 
Rich oily nose to the fore, bright acid and lime cordial on the front palate, dry texture. Great wine, got the structure and life of fruit to live another 5 years.  

2021 Four Winds Vineyard | Murrumbateman | 65 bottle
Tropical passionfruit and gooseberry start, middle and end. Defined acidity but a fantastically balanced wine. Wanna convince a Savvy drinker to switch to Riz?
 
2021 Lark Hill Estate  | Bungendore | 100 bottle  
Right on the money for refined, powerful and complete Canberra Riz. Elegant and vibrant citrus, juicy granny smith, a whiff of grapefruit above subtle ginger spice. Biodynamic.

2008 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2021 McKellar Ridge Reserve  | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle | 20 glass
Crunchy green apple and pineapple on the nose followed by searing lime juice cordial on the palate. Steely texture and a kiss of residual on the finish. Super dry, clean, crisp and fresh. Wowsers its got some length to it.
2019 Sholto | Murrumbateman | 75 bottle 
Rich floral nose, with a sweetness taken back by clean acidity and tight texture. Orange, pear and mandarin on the palate. Dry finish. Super quirky and different for CBR Riesling and highly enjoyable. 

2021 Lark Hill Regional   | Hilltops & Bungendore | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Sweet meyer lemon and floral notes on the nose and palate, a lovely, fresh off-dry style. Predominantly Hilltops fruit with a dab from the Lark Hill estate. Satisfies a sweet-tooth without being scary sweet. 
Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2021 Schwarz Wine Co. | Eden Valley, SA | 70 bottle | 17 glass
A lovely little number from Eden Valley. Apple sherbet on the nose, tight citrus and crunchy green pear palate. Zippy acidity. Delicious way to start.
2019 Sons of Eden Cirrus  Single Vineyard  | Eden Valley, SA | 95 bottle  
Vibrant and bursting with citrus; lemon, grapefruit and kaffir lime leaf. Minerally, refined, balanced. The epitome of Eden Riz. 

2017 Loosen-Barry Wolta Wolta  | Clare Valley, SA | 180 bottle 
A marriage of ‘royal’ families; the Barry’s from Clare and the Loosen’s from Mosel in Germany. The result? A spectacular example of Clare Riesling. Ripe lime and white nectarine on the nose and palate, fine texture and complex. 

2021 Worlds Apart In the Flowers  | Eden Valley, SA | 75 bottle  
Elegant and balanced. Soft edges on a floral and citrus nose, generously textured from time in barrel, cumquat and honeydew on the palate. Lingers. 

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. An aged beauty. 

2007 Clos Clare Museum Release | Clare Valley, SA | 95 bottle  
Rich lime skins and lanolin on the nose, a toasted nuttiness even. Soft lime cordial and slight floral tones on the palate. Remarkably fresh for its age, but that says a lot for the makers and the vineyard.  

2020 Mac Forbes RS22  | Strathbogie Ranges, Vic | 85 bottle  
Fermented in oak, 22g/l residual, ph 3.04. The back label is full of stats. What it doesn’t say is that this wine is effing delicious! Depths of minerals and earthy tones on the nose, medium palate weight. A delicate balance between the sugar, acidity and oak influences. Beautifully reminiscent of the best of Alsace. 

2019 Whistle and Hope | Wangaratta, Vic | 65 bottle 
Matt Kilby does one thing; make Riesling. Therefore the love and care he has for it shows up in the glass; a deliciously balanced, clean Riz with citrus drive and soft floral, herby notes on the nose.  

2020 Dr. Edge East  | East Coast, Tas | 90 bottle 
Complex from 9 months on lees in old oak. Delicate, dancing, dry palate. Leaning on the warmer citrus spectrum of cumquat and cardamom spice. Then the finish; dry as a bone, searing lemon pith. Lots of character, a very thoughtful wine. 
2017 Pressing Matters R9  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 85 bottle
A complete Riesling, and one for all occasions. A dabble of residual sugar 9g/l lefts a softened texture to an otherwise dry palate. Tropical honeydew wrapped in soft citrus. Deliciously drinkable. 
2017 Waterton Hall | Tamar Valley, Tas | 75 bottle  
From the very edge of the Tamar River, made by Brian Croser (and Co.) A super aged nose to something still quite young, slate, lime and floral notes.  

International Rieslings
The old world gets pretty worked up about who ‘owns’ Riesling. The Germans, the Austrians, the French. For us: who cares? Just drink the stuff. 

2020 Loosen Dr. L  | Mosel, Germany | 65 bottle | 16 glass 
	Charred pineapple and subtle lychee on the nose. Vibrant palate with tight acidity and sweet tropical fruit. Balanced and extremely smashable. Bargain. Not the Mosel of old, thankfully.  

2017 Wittmann Aulerde GG | Rheinhessen, Germany | 220 bottle  
Insanely powerful, insanely dry. Super fine and tight Riesling, with ripe yellow fruit on the palate, a little spice throughout. Dual personality; generous nose, lean palate. Utterly brilliant.  

2018 Angsar Clusserath Apotheke  Spatlese | Mosel, Germany | 125 bottle
Ripened apple, grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose with a layer of floral and menthol notes. Palate of juicy fruit, fine acidity, long finish. Super. 

2014 Gunderloch Rothenberg  GG  | Rheinhessen, Germany | 300 bottle 
From a site reminiscent of Coonawarra’s terra rossa, producing this elegant and intense pink grapefruit and spice character. Incredible network of secondary flavours, minerals and spice. Super special and complex.  

2019 Robert Weil Kiedrich Grafenberg  GG  | Rheingau, Germany | 280 bottle
From a site classified as GG or equivalent since the 1860s. Super fine and intense dry example with pure pink grapefruit, lemon and white stonefruit. Crazy long and slightly savoury finish.  

2018 A Christmann IDIG  GG | Pfalz, Germany | 250 bottle 
Spice, herb and tropical fruit on the nose, then hitting the lemon curd/apple spectrum that’s a bit more familiar to an Aussie palate. Powerful, intense finish. 

2020 Emmerich Knoll Ried Loibenberg  | Wachau, Austria | 110 bottle  
Yellow grapefruit and nectarine on the nose and palate. A tinge of juicy citrus acidity. Long finish, clean and almost silky dry Austrian Riz. 

2016 Groiss Ried Auf Der Henne  Reserve | Weinviertel, Austria | 150 bottle  
White blossoms and stonefruit on the nose and palate. A nip of residual but well balanced. 12hr maceration on skins and and 10 months on lees means there is serious texture and volume. Complex. Brilliant. Take your time.  

2020 Paul Blanck | Alsace, France | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Beautifully ripe pineapple, grapefruit and honeydew on the nose. Well balanced on the palate with acid and sugar tingling the senses and a distinct Alsace minerality lingering finish. Impressive and good value for imported. 

2017 Domaine Ostertag Muenchberg Grand Cru  | Alsace, France | 170  bottle
Apricots and peaches, with a well integrated spice and a hint of saline. This Grand Cru block was first planted in the 12th Century by Cistercian monks. 

2017 Charteris Hunt Vineyard  | Central Otago, New Zealand | 80 bottle 
Aged medium dry Riesling from Bannockburn. A beautiful balance to it; still a fresh wine but signs of ageing (bit like myself), veering tropical on the palate with racy acidity over a slight viscosity. Beautifully crafted. 

Tim’s Page
Who is Tim? Tim is your mate. You know? The fella with discerning taste, loves dry wines with a bit of a backstory or a bit of age on them. Or both. He’s keen for a chat, and knows heaps more about wine than Andy. So here’s to you Tim – enjoy some speccy’s ordered in with you in mind.

2007 Clos Clare Museum Release | Clare Valley, SA | 95 bottle  
Rich lime skins and lanolin on the nose, a toasted nuttiness even. Soft lime cordial and slight floral tones on the palate. Remarkably fresh for its age, but that says a lot for the makers and the vineyard.  

2008 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. An aged beauty. 2011 stashed away somewhere too.

2014 Gunderloch Rothenberg  GG  | Rheinhessen, Germany | 300 bottle 
From a site reminiscent of Coonawarra’s terra rossa, producing this elegant and intense pink grapefruit and spice character. Incredible network of secondary flavours, minerals and spice. Super special and complex.  

2016 Groiss Ried Auf Der Henne  Reserve  |  Weinviertel, Austria  |  150 bottle  
White blossoms and stonefruit on the nose and palate. A nip of residual but well balanced. 12hr maceration on skins and and 10 months on lees means there is serious texture and volume. Complex. Brilliant. Take your time.  

2020 L.A.S Vino CBDB  | Margaret River, WA | 120 bottle 
100% chenin blanc from Margaret River is given the full treatment; wild yeast ferment, French barriques and clay amphora, lees stirring. The result is a textured, layered wine with a tonne of character from sharp citrus to stone fruit and almond nougat. Awesome.

2018 Eden Road Block 71 Cullarin  Syrah | Lake George, CBR | 90 bottle 
Shiraz exclusively from the first vineyard ever planted in the district on the verge of Lake George. Pristine quality fruit, all red and blue, light Sichuan pepper through the palate. Fine french oak is evident. Phenomenal length and finish. 






Other white wines do exist.
A select list of whites that aren’t Riesling that are definitely worth sharing

2021 Mada Blanc  | Hilltops, NSW | 65 bottle 
Gewurz, Gris and Riesling rolling around in the sheets to make a delicious, aromatic, dry white. Light on the palate, you literally get the influence of each varietal through the palate; gewurz to start, mid palate a lovely Gris pear smash, and finishing with the classic riz citrus zing. Banger. 

2018 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 130 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak and in bottle, a real thinker’s white. Pioneers here in Canberra and recognized as one of the country’s best GV producers.

2021 Linear Fiano | Hilltops, NSW | 65 bottle 
Fresh pressed Packham pear juice, granny smiths and a light white pepper element to this super dry, lively and fresh white from Young NSW. Easily confused for a lively CBR riz quite frankly… 

2021 Hahndorf Hill Gru  Gruner Veltliner | Adelaide Hills, SA | 70 bottle 
Citrus, nectarine and spice on the nose; stonefruit and grapefruit on the palate finished by a long mineral finish with a bit of texture. Highly acclaimed and great value Aussie Gruner. 

2021 Mountain People Pinot Gris | Orange, NSW | 60 bottle | 15 glass 
Skin contact Gris from the Borrodell vineyard high up on the slopes of Mount Canobolas. Light amber, a lovely aromatic nose of nectarine and rosewater, and a dry palate of pear and white pepper. Lovely and approachable. 

2020 L.A.S Vino CBDB  | Margaret River, WA | 120 bottle 
100% chenin blanc from Margaret River is given the full treatment; wild yeast ferment, French barriques and clay amphora, lees stirring. The result is a textured, layered wine with a tonne of character from sharp citrus to stone fruit and almond nougat. Awesome.

2019 Fraser Gallop Parterre  Chardonnay | Margaret River, WA | 90 bottle 
Refined and balanced. Fine acid, its not until the mid palate that you realise it is Chardy, and it is gooood chardy. Barrel fermented. Total Margaret River elegance. 

2018 Indigo Alpine Vineyards  Chardonnay | Beechworth, Vic | 80 bottle | 19 glass
A Yellowy green in the glass, ripe but refined nose of stonefruit and oak. Complex, refined, excellent rendition of Beechworth Chardy. Will continue to develop over time and get deeper as it goes. 

2021 Dr. Edge Amber  | Tamar Valley, Tas | 85 bottle 
A blend of Schoenburger and Gris from Northern Tas. Skinsy but clean, musk and apricot on the nose. More stonefruit and green pear on the light and dry palate, grippy finish to be expected. Delicious, and only slightly-hipster-juice. 





The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

2021 Gilbert Pet-nat Riesling | Orange, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Crispy and minimal funk. Cloudy apple cider to the eye, green apple and lime on the nose and palate, mouth-filling fizz. Delicious. GT Young Winemaker of the Year 2021. 

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles. Simple, clean, balanced. 

2015 Stefano Lubiana Brut Rose  | Derwent Valley, Tas | 95 bottle 
100% biodynamic Pinot Noir. Super elegant, crispy and crunchy red berries on the palate, perfumed, and a nice hit of richness. Great Tassie bubbles. 

2019 Dr Loosen Sekt Sparkling Riesling | Mosel, Germany | 90 bottle  
Powerful nose of citrus and tropical fruits and trademark slatieness of Mosel. As dry as a german sparkling can be from one of the masters.  

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Nature  | Champagne, Fra | 170 bottle 
A new one to their impressive stable. For me its like a cross with my other fave; Bolly. Its richer in style than the cristal clear intensity of the above, more honey’on’toast and brioche, nutty notes. An absolute killer. 

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 


Rose 
Pretty, pretty dry, and pretty good with arvo sunshine

2021 Mount Majura Rosado | Majura, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
100% Graciano from new plantings. Pale in the glass, redcurrant and melon on the nose,  and then this lovely spiced red fruit and pink grapefruit palate with hints of white pepper. Dry, with a lovely clean texture. 

2020 Domaine Sainte-Marie | Provence, France | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Classic Provence style rose. Grenache based. Dry and super pretty, strawberries and cream with secondary raspberry and watermelon on the palate. An absolute belter in the sun.

2020 Vinden & Gilbert Lignee  Rose | Central Ranges, NSW | 135 magnum
Countless varietals, thrice as many ferments. Some serious effort put in to this gem of a rose. Aromatic, dry, textural and fun. Enjoyable and just hip enough to make it in Braddon. 
A Concise list of Reds
Listed lightest to heaviest, kinda

2019 Linear Pinot Noir | Tumbarumba, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass 
Distinct deep fleshy red cherry on the nose with a hint of savouriness. Cherry and red plum again on the palate, with a complex of smoky nuttiness. Super fine tannin. Well balanced.  

2017 Pressing Matters Pinot Noir | Coal River Valley, Tas | 170 bottle
Pressing Matters does Riesling and Pinot Noir. That’s all. And they’re damn good at them. Light in the glass, Red and dark cherry on the palate, super fine tannin. Sweet then a slight savoury and earthy finish. Intriguing Pinot.

2020 Somos Aglianico | McLaren Vale, SA | 75 bottle | 17 glass
A very pretty light dry red; southern Italy’s Pinot. Its got grip and funk, black cherry and fennel seed nose, complex red and blue fruit on the palate. Dry clean finish. 

2020 Ministry of Clouds Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 80 bottle
A 100-yr old bush vine vineyard in Blewitt Springs. So it’s good. Good fruit weight, richer style with hints of spice through the palate. Really well made. Good structure and acidity. Perfectly hitting that medium bodied red pitch.  

2017 Vino de Montana Field Blend | Sierra de Gata, Spain | 75 bottle | 18 glass	
Grenache dominant field blend with dashes of indigenous Rufete and Pinuela. Perfumed red fruit and spice, aniseed and cherry on the palate. Delicious, frightfully easy to knock back light dry red.

2017 Sholto Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle 
A very pretty and light expression of CBR Razla. Red fruit, spice and Sichuan on the nose with a slight smoked meat  character.  Delectable soft fruit and fine tannin on the palate. Really enjoyable light dry red. 

2019 Long Rail Gully Shiraz | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass 
Red berries, spice and liquorice on the nose, light and juicy on the palate; red fruit turning to dark cherry and blood plum through the palate. Allrounder.

2018 Te Mata Bullnose  Syrah | Hawke’s Bay, NZ | 140 bottle 
An Iconic Syrah from a single vineyard in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand. Perfume and spice on the nose, richly blue + red fruits galore, and a fine silky finish. 

2019 Ravensworth Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 130 bottle
In one word? Super. Super floral and brambly nose. Super red fruit and white pepper on the palate. Super use of fine European oak equals super fine tannins and a super finish. Like I said, just super.  

2016 Lark Hill Scuro  Sangiovese + Shiraz | Murrumbateman, CBR | 130 bottle 
A blend of Sangiovese and Shiraz grown on Lark Hill’s Dark Horse Vineyard  at murrumbateman. Rich, intense, dark and generous. Still that lovely CBR shiraz perfume but some power and weight to it.   

2010 Paulmara Syna  Shiraz | Barossa Valley, SA | 155 bottle 
An old-school, big Barossan. American oak. Rich date and mocha on the nose with distinct vanillin, tannin crunch on the palate and big fruit throughout the lengthy palate. Decant for halfa before diving in. 



Big Format
For when the party strikes and its time to ball. Ball hard.  

Bubbles, Whites & Rose
NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 

2021 Mount Majura Riesling | Majura, CBR | 160 magnum
Quintessential Canberra style; Juicy lime and lemon palate with secondary granny smith. Superbly balanced, dry and a long zingy finish. 

2017 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  Riesling  | Frankland River, WA | 210 magnum
Another one of our all-time fave aussie riesling producers. Super dry, a lot of similarities to a CBR dry Riesling; minerally, lime and lemon juice, purity of fruit and a long, long finish. 

2018 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett | Mosel, Germany | 380 magnum 
Deep white fruit, quince and packed to the brim with blossom on the nose with distinct slateyness and the typical kabinett pang of sugar and acidity. Elegant as all Prums, and ageing gracefully.  

2020 Vinden & Gilbert Lignee  Rose | Central Ranges, NSW | 135 magnum
Countless varietals, thrice as many ferments. Some serious effort put in to this gem of a rose. Aromatic, dry, textural and fun. Enjoyable and just hip enough to make it in Braddon. 

Reds 
2010 Hans Herzog Pinot Noir | Marlborough, NZ | 280 magnum 
Marlborough exists in no small part due to Hans Herzog.. Supreme quality fruit, all handpicked. Dark cherry and raspberry, complex and fine, with a hint of spiced fruit cake underneath all that primary fruit. Unfined, unfiltered, hazy. 

2020 Vanguardist V  Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 625 jeraboam  
Graceful Grenache from the ‘silver sands’ vineyard at Blewitt Springs. Light ruby, slight haze, layered nose of red and blue berries, olive and oregano. Lots of concentrated red berry characters, anise, spice  and defined structure. Fine oak use. Medium weight, dry, phenomenal length. Really, really good wine.   

2017 Torbreck The Struie  | Barossa & Eden Valleys, SA | 280 magnum  
 Perfumed and concentrated; a wet spring followed by near-perfect ripening at the tail end of summer. Plum, blackberry and spice all over. Structured and velvety, willing us to stash away for another decade but very drinkable now.




Dessert style Rieslings 
From beautifully light, to thick and rich, sweet style Rieslings can do anything! Listed here from least to most residual sugar.

2019 Lark Hill Ley-Line  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Pale yellow, medium-bodied sticky with zingy acidity and beautiful ripe pineapple palate.

2021 Frogmore Creek Iced Riesling  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2021 Mount Horrocks Cordon Cut  | Clare Valley, SA | 90 bottle
Dense and concentrated thanks to the cane-cut process. Juicy citrus, spring florals and spice. Impressively sweet and long, yet acidity prevents cloy. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish. 

2017 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 150 bottle
Dense and concentrated. Raisin and crispy citrus on the nose give way to stonefruit and white cherry on the palate. Incredible booze. Still has a zippy acid backbone underneath all that fleshy goodness.
