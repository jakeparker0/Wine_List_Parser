We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some Riesling impersonators, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 

2020 Lark Hill Canberra Region  | Young + Bungendore | 60 bottle
Floral nose, zesty amber citrus on the palate. Super light, bright and delicious. Mostly from the Freeman vineyard at Young, thus avoiding the smoke taint that smashed the Canberra district. 9.2% ABV makes it an all-day wine. 

2019 Yarrh | Murrumbateman | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Sharp citrus and minerality. Dry, light and moorish. Great value classic Canberra style Riesling from just north of Murrumbateman. 

2018 Clonakilla | 80 bottle 
Power and precision, like all Clonakilla wines. Buckets of lime, super tight acidity and it just keeps going and going…

2017 Nick O’Leary Heywood  | Hall | 80 bottle 
Exceptional value single-site Riesling from Nick’s home plot. Citrus and hints of crisp green melon. Well balanced acidity. Classic Nick.  

2011 Eden Road | Murrumbateman | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Rich oily nose to the fore, bright acid and lime cordial on the front palate, dry texture. Great wine, got the structure and life of fruit to live another 5 years. 

2019 Gallagher | Jeir | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Bright lemon curd, mandarin, honey, minerality. Superbly balanced, great finish. Clapping emoji.

2019 Mount Majura | 70 bottle 
Juicy lemon palate with a long steely finish. Superbly balanced and quintessentially Canberran. Reliably great Riesling year in, year out. 

2019 Helm Classic  | Murrumbateman | 75 bottle 
Classic for a reason. Crisp lime and lemon juice aromas, Canberra minerality. Dry as could be. Perfect young, definitely ageable, good value. 

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2015 Lark Hill Estate  back-vintage | Bungendore | 120 bottle 
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. A veritable bevvy of citrus on the palate. Great length. Wildly enjoyable. Biodynamic. 

2019 Four Winds | 60 bottle | 15 glass
An off-dry style; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from an excellent producer. 

2019 Helm Half Dry  | Murrumbateman | 55 bottle | 14 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.


The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 13 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2019 Four Winds Sparkling Riesling | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle | 15 glass
Crisp grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose and on the palate, light and fresh with zingy acidity. Refreshing. Spring in a glass.  

2011 Lark Hill Chardonnay Pinot Noir | Bungendore, Canberra District | 110 bottle 
Probably the best vintage sparkling from mainland Aus, in our humble opinion. Comparable to your generous champagne styles; biscuits, honey, and crisp acidity. Yum.

2019 Dr Loosen Sekt  Sparkling Riesling  | Mosel, Germany | 90 bottle 
Powerful nose of citrus and tropical fruits and trademark slatieness of Mosel. As dry as a german sparkling can be from one of the masters. 

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 


Rose 
Pretty, pretty dry, and pretty good with arvo sunshine

2020 Vinden Headcase  | Hunter Valley, NSW | 65 bottle 
What do you get when ‘the next big thing’ from the Hunter blends 6 different ferments of Tempranillo, Semillon, Shiraz, Chardy & gewürztraminer? A bloody delicious rose. Aromatic with herbs and redcurrant on the nose, hint of citrus and white pepper on the palate, finishing dry and textural. Served chilled, but awesome room temp as well. 

2018 Artea | Alpes de Haute Provence, France | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Very pretty nose. Another dry rose, dry flower petals and strawberry/cranberry on the nose. Good long finish. Great little French rose especially for the price. Smashable.
 
NV M & J Becker Wines ODP  Rose | Sonoma, USA | 85 bottle
Rich, deep, complex, dry, quirky, confronting. This wine is just an awesome curiosity from Meagan and James Becker, based at Oakvale in the Hunter but also making cracking wines from California. A 60/40 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from multiple vintages for a true ‘field blend’. Inspired stuff.  More amber than rose. 


Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2019 Grosset Polish Hill  | Clare Valley, SA | 230 magnum 
THE definitive Clare; bone dry, intense citrus and cool slate with a persistent finish. Everything tastes better from a magnum. 

2019 Mac Forbes RS3  | Strathbogie Ranges, Vic | 150 magnum 
A fine wine of structure and persistence. Or does the persistence come from getting through 1500ml of it? I dunno.
Fermented in stainless and also oak and concrete makes for a textured but clean Riesling, dry as the residual sugar indicator name suggests.

2014 Place in Time | Clare Valley, SA | 100 bottle 
Heard of Pike’s? Yeah. So chief winemaker Steve Baraglia also has this side project and it’s safe to say he knows his way around a Riesling vintage or two. The 2014 still has years to run in it, with searing acidity and that classic Clare lime juice and structure to the fore. 

2014 Mitchell Watervale  Riesling | Clare Valley, SA | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Superb value aged Riesling from Clare Valley. Zippy acidity has had the shock absorbers tuned by 6 years in bottle to find a really happy, sporty ride. Still the classic Clare lime juice cordial effect, but with a heavier palate weight and approachability. 
2012 Crawford River | Henty, Vic | 185 bottle 
Mainland Australia’s foremost Riesling producer. Supreme ageability from super their site planted in the 1970’s in Henty. Still a youthful green, very delicate with soft floral notes on the nose, apple skins and a hint of white peach on the palate. Acidity has barely softened and this wine still has a good two decades in it yet. 

2018 Tertini Yaraandoo  | Southern Highlands, NSW | 75 bottle 
Good clean nose, sharp grippy acidity with a fresh citrus palate. Really light and lean style Creates the salavating effect that makes you want more. Winner. Good with chicken dinner. 

2020 Castle Rock Estate Porongurup  | Frankland River, WA | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Brilliantly bright and lively. Good minerality to it too, but citrus on citrus up on this one. Will age well, but super delicious right now. 

2019 Frankland River Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 75 bottle
Very clean and very dry, crisp granny smith on the palate with zippy acidity and good tight finish. The west is turning out some stunners.

2018 Stefano Lubiana | Derwent Valley, Tas | 80 bottle
Deliciously light citrus, with a good mouthfeel coming from some time in old oak. Very good booze. Tassie wines, so hot right now, Tassie wines…

2018 Stargazer Palisander Vineyard  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 100 bottle 
Steely nose, fresh light citrus, followed by a perfectly balanced palate; not overly dry or sweet. A melody of citrus from lime juice to fresh orange oil. One of the top Tassie Rieslings. 

International Rieslings
The old world gets pretty worked up about who ‘owns’ Riesling. The Germans, the Austrians, the French. For us: who cares? Just drink the stuff. 

2017 Donnhoff | Nahe, Germany | 75 bottle | 18 glass
Soft and rounded, slightly sweet, with tropical fruit and pear on the palate. Great value German off-dry Rizla.

2018 Wittmann Morstein  GG | Rheinhessen, Germany | 250 bottle 
Insanely powerful, insanely dry. Super fine and tight Riesling, with ripe yellow fruit on the palate, a little spice throughout. A paradox of generous nose, lean palate. Utterly brilliant. 

2018 Dr Loosen Wehlener Sonnenuhr Trocken GG | Mosel, Germany | 150 bottle 
Light and spritzy tropical fruit on the palate, a truly top tier ‘grand cru’ German. A persistent and delicate, pretty Riesling. Simply delicious. 

2014 JJ Prum Graacher Himmelreich Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 170 bottle
Bright and fresh on the nose with the distinct slate and minerality. Slight fizz, intense acidity and honeyed apricot on the palate. How good is the Rielsing spectrum of fruits!? 7% ABV makes it almost a driving wine.

2006 Georg Breuer Nonnenberg  GG  | Rheingau, Germany | 200 bottle
Fleshy and generous Riesling and still maturing. Acidity lingers underneath the richer palate. From 80yr-old vines in the middle of the GG site, truly special booze. 

2012 Emmerich Knoll VInothekfullung Loibner  | Wachau, Austria | 210 bottle 
Super rare find. An phenomenal example of age bringing balance to the force. Acidity is delicate but lingers, textured and with generous fruit. Incredible. 

2018 Willm Reserve  | Alsace, France | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Beautifully ripe, lush nose with honey and floral notes followed by a well-balanced delivery of fruit and tight acidity. Absolute bargain frenchy. 

2018 Domaine Ostertag Les Jardins | Alsace, France | 260 magnum
White flowers, peach and vine-blossom aromas, followed by a rounded texture and a fine and long acidity. A slight saline character in the finish. Graceful Alsace. Biodynamic producer. 

2018 G D Vajra Petracine  | Langhe, Italy | 95 bottle 
The pioneer of Riesling in Piedmont in Italy’s north west. There’s a lot to like in this one, especially if you’re fond of the Clare Valley. Lime, green apple, slight floral notes and a slatey texture. Built to last but vibrant now. 

2013 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 80 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser makes brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2013 was a slightly cooler year, and this is a ripe Riesling with tropical fruit on the nose, citrus on the palate and a racy acidity.

2018 Rippon Jeunesse  | Central Otago, New Zealand | 90 bottle
Described as ‘like a child’s crayon drawing; vibrant, spirited, endearing’. We don’t know what that means, but the wine is seriously drinkable; well balanced, clean citrus, light and minerally. Yum.
This is for the G’s 
The imitators of, and close friends to, Riesling

2019 Mount Majura Pinot Gris | Majura, Canberra District | 60 bottle 
Dry style gris from just up the road; Stonefruit and pear juice with very subtle spice. Highly smashable. 

2018 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 130 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak and in bottle, a real thinker’s white. Pioneers here in Canberra and recognized as one of the country’s best GV producers.

2020 Vinden Headcase Blanc  | Hunter Valley, NSW | 75 bottle	
So we’re just a wee bit excited about Vinden wines. A gun young winemaker making super interesting booze from a typically ‘conservative’ wine region. The 2020 blanc is anyone’s guess for what’s in it, but its textural, aromatic, dry and just really really good wine. One for the ‘skins’ and ‘natural wines’ crowd for sure. 

2019 Hahndorf Hill Gru  Gruner Veltliner | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Citrus, nectarine and spice on the nose; stonefruit and grapefruit on the palate finished by a long mineral finish with a bit of texture. 

2019 Long Rail Gully Cetiri  Blend  | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle 
Cetiri; a blend of Gris, Semillon, Gewurztraminer, and Riesling. Lifted aromatics, gewurz perfume is dominant, soft acid. Nice dry aromatic white.


Worthy & worldly Whites
2019 Vinden Estate Verdelho | Hunter Valley, NSW | 60 bottle	
Ripe tropical fruit, medium-bodied, tight acidity. None of that chalky texture that plagues this Portuguese workhorse. 

2013 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. You’d have no idea its 7-years old, still as fresh as tomorrow. 

2016 Fighting Gully Road Chardonnay | Beechworth, Vic | 80 bottle | 20 glass
A generous chardonnay from a top vineyard from one of Australia’s top regions from one of Australia’s best wine makers Adrian Rodda. Wild ferment in French oak, a powerful balance between stonefruit and citrus characters and a super clean finish. Awesome Chard. 

2018 Nick Spencer Chardonnay | Tumbarumba, NSW | 70 bottle 
A pretty yet full-bodied expression from the Marangle vineyard, matured in French oak puncheons for structure and balance adding to the stonefruit and citrus palate.

2018 Vanguardist Chardonnay | Adelaide Hills, SA | 110 bottle 
Tight and lean style chardy; plenty of citrus and spice with lemon, zest and a hint of anise. Good length from persistent acidity and steely texture. For the Chablis lovers out there.

Listed lightest to heaviest, kinda

2016 Boovability Pinot Noir | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle 
A Super light red; bright fresh sweet cherry fruit on the front palate, savoury mid palate, good length and a twist of spice on the finish. Beautifully smashable cool climate Pinot from Adelaide Hills. 

2018 Stargazer Palisander Vineyard  Pinot Noir | Coal River Valley, Tas | 160 bottle
One of the best Pinot regions in the country and this is one of the best examples. Bright and light, good acidity tying it all together, incredibly perfumed and long long finish. Super wine. 

2019 Hahndorf Hill Zsa Zsa  Zweigelt | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle | 16 glass
How do you describe a wine that can take you from thinking of Pinot to Cabernet in the flash of an eye? You don’t. You just drink it. Enjoy. 

2019 Nick Spencer MDR Shiraz Blend | Gundagai, NSW | 80 bottle 
Shiraz + Cabernet + Malbec + Tempranillo + Touriga = MDR magic! 
Medium bodied, spice and fruit and character from the lighter grapes, with plenty of grip and body from the heavier varietals. A well balanced, punchy wine showing off the virtues of Gundagai.  

2017 Rocky Gully Shiraz | Frankland River, WA | 60 bottle | 15 glass
A brilliant, light expression of Shiraz with remarkable similarities to Canberra District; red fruit, white pepper on the nose and palate, spice and perfume. 

2019 Sholto Rouge Clair  Blend | Gundaroo, CBR | 70 bottle | 17 glass
A quirky wine. Cabernet, Malbec and a splash of Petit Verdot made into a ‘beaujolais’ style light red. We love it, and you will too once you get over the preconception of what those grapes ‘should’ be.

2017 Fighting Gully Road Sangiovese | Beechworth, Vic | 80 bottle
Blackberry and a hint of olive on the palate, great mouthfeel and lingering finish. Superb light-medium red grown by Mark Walpole. 

2017 Casa Silva Carmenere | Colchagua Valley, Chile | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Distinctly earthy nose, ripe black fruit and a defined grip gives it structure. Reminds me a bit of a cross between a well-made Cabernet and a Spanish tempranillo; brambly, bit meaty, smoky and definitely savoury. Bargain. 

2014 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 250 bottle 
The Ron Burgundy of Canberra reds; it’s kind of a big deal. Great vintage of a super wine; elegant, perfumed, precise, medium-bodied. Simply a great wine and a main reason behind Clonakilla being the flagship of Murrumbateman. 

2018 Te Mata Bullnose  Syrah | Hawke’s Bay, NZ | 140 bottle 
An Iconic Syrah from a single vineyard in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand. Perfumed and spice on the nose, richly blue and red fruits galore, and a fine silky finish. Brilliant. 

2016 Penley Estate 11 Barrels  Shiraz | Coonawarra, SA | 100 bottle
Reward yourself with a cracking Shiraz from Cabernet country. That classic terra rossa character with medium weight red and blue fruit. I’m super chuffed with this wine so I bought the entire ACT allocation. 




Dessert style Rieslings 
From beautifully light, to thick and rich, sweet style Rieslings can do anything! Listed here from least to most residual sugar.

2019 Lark Hill Ley-Line  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Pale yellow, medium-bodied sticky with zingy acidity and beautiful ripe pineapple palate.

2019 Frogmore Creek Iced Riesling  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2019 Mitchelton Late Harvest Riesling | Nagambie, Vic | 70 bottle
Pale in colour but a really lifted intense nose of floral and lychee. Tropical with the slightest tickle of gingery citrus on the palate. Well balanced with good acidity to tackle the sugar. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish. 

2016 Framingham F-series  Trockenbeerenauslese  | Marlborough, NZ | 170 bottle
Imagine a big bowl of apricots covered in honey, spices and drizzled caramel. Then liquify it. Supreme intensity, sweetness and balanced by acidity. Top stuff.
