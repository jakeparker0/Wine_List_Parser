We’re all about the Riesling. 

In winter we’re all about the Shiraz. 

So… lets call this ‘Rizla does Razla’. 

Yes, we’ve got phenomenal drops besides Rizla and Razla; there’s some Riesling impersonators like your Gris and Gruner, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles, some serious bubbles, and a short list of seriously good ‘other’ reds. 

But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘king and queen of grapes in Canberra’ and their ability to go with such a diverse range of cuisines.  

The Canberra District has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past two decades, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!

Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 
50-odd producers, 70-odd Rieslings in a vintage. This is just a list of highlights

2019 Sapling Yard Bungendore  | Bungendore | 70 bottle 
Lush floral nose followed by racy lemony acidity and effervescence on the front palate. Good balance and tight minerality. Good long finish. Winemaker Carla Rodeghiero is also vigneron, picker and delivery driver!

2021 Vintner’s Daughter | Murrumbateman | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Bright white peach and floral nose leading to a tight palate of peach, lemon zest and a minerally dryness. Grown at Four Winds. Deliciously different. 

2019 Brindabella Hills | Hall | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Classic Canberra Riesling from the hills overlooking the Murrumbidgee about 35kms WNW of Canberra. Dry with heaps of citrus on the nose and palate. 

2019 Long Rail Gully | Murrumbateman | 60 bottle | 15 Glass
A light and aromatic style, with dried mandarin on the nose and fresh lime juice on the palate. An enduring clean finish. Very good.

2017 Collector City West  | Tumbarumba | 80 bottle
but Tumby is heavily raided by CBR makers so lets just go right ahead and claim it as a CBR sub-region, shall we? This is showing aged complexity, deep minerality and herbaceous tones on the nose; then a curious mix of mandarin, cumquat and fennel seed on the palate. Long, lingering finish. 

2019 Helm Classic  | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle 
Classic for a reason. Crisp lime and lemon juice aromas, Canberra minerality. Dry as could be. Perfect young, definitely ageable, good value. 

2021 Nick O’Leary White Rocks  | Lake George, CBR | 80 bottle 
Only just in bottle so its fresh AF. Light, bright citrus and citrus blossom on the nose, racy acidity. Crunchy apple and lime. Long minerally finish. Oh snap!

2014 Lark Hill Estate  back-vintage | Bungendore | 130 bottle  
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. A veritable bevvy of citrus on the palate. Great length. Wildly enjoyable. Biodynamic.  

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2016 Ravensworth back-vintage | Murrumbateman | 100 bottle 
Lively lemon and fennel on the nose, bright and steely on the front palate. Starting to show some age but this will live for another 15 years plus.

2019 Sholto | Murrumbateman | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Rich floral nose, with a sweetness taken back by clean acidity and tight texture. Orange, pear and mandarin on the palate. Dry finish. Super quirky and different for CBR Riesling and highly enjoyable. 

2019 Helm Half Dry  | Murrumbateman | 55 bottle | 14 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.

Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2019 Grosset Polish Hill  | Clare Valley, SA | 230 magnum 
THE definitive Clare; bone dry, intense citrus and cool slate with a persistent finish. Everything tastes better from a magnum. 

2019 Sons of Eden Freya  | Eden Valley, SA | 70 bottle 
Light and clean on the nose, a flush of crisp citrus blossom and lemon juice on the palate. A hint of savouriness and a long bouncy finish. A cracker.  
2017 Loosen-Barry Wolta Wolta  | Clare Valley, SA | 180 bottle 
A marriage of ‘royal’ families; the Barry’s from Clare and the Loosen’s from Mosel in Germany. The result? A spectacular example of Clare Riesling. Ripe lime and white nectarine on the nose and palate, fine texture and complex. 

2020 Ministry of Clouds | Clare Valley, SA | 75 bottle 
Generous citrus nose, deceptively soft on the front palate too. Then, whoompa! There’s that Clare acidity and sharpness. A classic in the making.

2020 Poppelvej ØST | Adelaide Hills, SA | 85 bottle
Cloudy pear juice to the eye, bursting with crispy dry lemon juice and chamomile on the nose and palate. Grippy from 3 weeks on skins. An undertone of caramel. Complex and delicious in moderation. 

2007 Clos Clare Museum Release  | Clare Valley, SA | 80 bottle | 19 glass
Rich lime skins and lanolin on the nose, a toasted nuttiness even. Soft lime cordial and slight floral tones on the palate. Remarkably fresh for its age, but that says a lot for the makers and the vineyard. 

2012 Crawford River | Henty, Vic | 185 bottle 
Mainland Australia’s foremost Riesling producer. Supreme ageability from super their site planted in the 1970’s in Henty. Still a youthful green, very delicate with soft floral notes on the nose, apple skins and a hint of white peach on the palate. Acidity has barely softened.

2019 Best’s Foudre Ferment  | Great Western, Vic | 75 bottle 
One of Australia’s finest Riesling producers. This one is fermented in 2500L+ Foudre to create texture and body. Still dry, but with a lovely creaminess and length. Pear and lime bounce around in a delicious dance.  

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. An aged beauty. 

2018 Stargazer Palisander Vineyard  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 100 bottle 
Steely nose, fresh light citrus, followed by a perfectly balanced palate; not overly dry or sweet. A melody of citrus from lime juice to fresh orange oil. One of the finest examples of crystalline dry white. 


International Rieslings
The old world gets pretty worked up about who ‘owns’ Riesling. The Germans, the Austrians, the French. For us: who cares? Just drink the stuff. 

2019 Loosen Dr. L  | Nahe, Germany | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Charred pineapple and subtle lychee on the nose. Vibrant palate with tight acidity and sweet tropical fruit. Balanced and extremely smashable. Bargain. Not the Mosel of old, thankfully. 

2018 A Christmann IDIG  GG | Pfalz, Germany | 250 bottle 
Spice, herb and tropical fruit on the nose, then hitting the lemon curd/apple spectrum that’s a bit more familiar to an Aussie palate. Powerful, and an intense long finish. 

2019 Robert Weil Kiedrich Grafenberg  GG  | Rheinhessen, Germany | 280 bottle
From a site classified as GG or equivalent since the 1860s. Super fine and intense dry example with pure pink grapefruit, lemon and white stonefruit. Crazy long and slightly savoury finish.  

2018 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Kabinett | Mosel, Germany | 175 bottle
Deep white fruit, quince and packed to the brim with blossom on the nose with distinct slateyness and the typical kabinett pang of sugar and acidity. Elegant as all Prums, and ageing gracefully. 

2018 Angsar Clusserath Apotheke  Spatlese | Mosel, Germany | 125 bottle
Ripened apple, grapefruit and gooseberry on the nose with a layer of floral and menthol notes. Palate of juicy fruit, fine acidity, long finish. Super. 

2016 Groiss Ried Auf Der Henne  Reserve | Weinviertel, Austria | 150 bottle 
White blossoms and stonefruit on the nose and palate. A nip of residual but well balanced. 12hr maceration on skins and and 10 months on lees means there is serious texture and volume. Complex. Brilliant. Take your time. 

2012 Emmerich Knoll Schutt Durnsteiner Smaragd  | Wachau, Austria | 175 bottle 
The extreme of minerality in a riesling. Tones of peach, apricot and secret herbs and spices on the nose, mixing in with lime and passionfruit on the palate. Long, lean but in its bulking season; adding weight with age. 

2018 Jean-Luc Mader | Alsace, France | 85 bottle | 21 glass
Beautifully ripe grapefruit, melon and pineapple on the nose. Well balanced on the palate with acid and sugar tingling the senses and a distinct minerality.

2016 Willm Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru  | Alsace, Fra | 115 bottle
Zesty lemon on the nose and straw yellow in the glass. Plenty more citrus on the palate; lemon and grapefruit and hints of green apple. Dry, clean savoury. 

2017 Domaine Ostertag Muenchberg Grand Cru  | Alsace, France | 170  bottle
Apricots and peaches, with a well integrated spice and a hint of saline. This Grand Cru block was first planted in the 12th Century by Cistercian monks. Biodynamic producer.  

2011 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 80 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser makes brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2014 was a cooler year, and this is a ripe Riesling with tropical fruit on the nose, citrus on the palate and a racy acidity.
Tim’s Page
Who is Tim? Tim is your mate. You know? The fella with discerning taste, loves dry wines with a bit of a backstory or a bit of age on them. Or both. He’s keen for a chat, and knows heaps more about wine than Andy. So here’s to you Tim – enjoy some speccy’s ordered in with you in mind.

2014 Lark Hill Estate  back-vintage | Bungendore | 130 bottle  
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. A veritable bevvy of citrus on the palate. Great length. Wildly enjoyable. Biodynamic.  

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. We also have some of the 2008 Premium hanging about, not cold though. 

2007 Clos Clare Museum Release | Clare Valley, SA | 75 bottle | 19 glass
Rich lime skins and lanolin on the nose, a toasted nuttiness even. Soft lime cordial and slight floral tones on the palate. Remarkably fresh for its age, but that says a lot for the makers and the vineyard. 

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. An aged beauty. 

2016 Groiss Ried Auf Der Henne  Reserve | Weinviertel, Austria | 150 bottle

2012 Emmerich Knoll Schutt Durnsteiner Smaragd  | Wachau, Austria | 175 bottle 
The extreme of minerality in a riesling. Tones of peach, apricot and secret herbs and spices on the nose, mixing in with lime and passionfruit on the palate. Long, lean but in its bulking season; adding weight with age. 

2014 Brundlmeyer Terrassen  | Kamptal, Austria | 115 bottle 
From selected terrace vineyards of the estate. You know how long-lived Brundlmeyer Rieslings are, and as this one was made in a youthful style its hitting its straps between lively fruit and acid and mature body. Not kept cold.

2016 Willm Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru  | Alsace, Fra | 115 bottle
Zesty lemon on the nose and straw yellow in the glass. Plenty more citrus on the palate; lemon and grapefruit and hints of green apple. Dry, clean savoury. 

2011 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 80 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser makes brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2014 was a cooler year, and this is a ripe Riesling with tropical fruit on the nose, citrus on the palate and a racy acidity.

2014 Eden Road 94 Block  Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 90 bottle 
Shiraz exclusively from the Eden Road home block a few clicks south of Murrumbateman. Pristine quality fruit, all red and blue, light Sichuan pepper through the palate. Fine french oak is evident. Phenomenal length and finish. 


The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 14 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2017 Wallaroo Sparkling Riesling | Hall, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Mouthfillng fizz, refreshing lemon on the palate with acid and sugar in great balance. Long finish with great texture. Highly enjoyable. 

2019 Mada Sui Generis  Pet Nat | Hilltops, NSW | 70 bottle
Fun funky bubbles from near Young NSW. Predominantly Nebbiolo grapes but a splash of Riesling and Chardonnay to add a bit of complexity and interest. Deep amber colour, grippy and textural, strawberries and peach on the palate. 

2015 Daosa Blanc de Blanc  | Adelaide Hills, SA | 145 bottle
100% chardy from the Piccadilly Valley and arguably one of Australia’s best vintage BdBs. 30 Months on lees. Medium yellow in the glass, nougat and nutty goodness on the nose, generous richness of fruit through the spectrum; tropical to citrus and stonefruit. Long dry finish. Better than champagne?

NV Louis Roederer Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 170 bottle
The epitome of straight-down-the-middle non vintage champagne; bright citrus and blossom, super fine bead, acidity balanced by supple yeast making for a toasty long finish. Practically sells itself. 

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 


Rose 
Pretty, pretty dry, and pretty good with arvo sunshine

2020 Freeman Rondo Rondinella Rose | Hilltops, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Very pretty aromatic nose of nectarine and currants. Red currants and berries on the palate, dry with a tight but not overbearing acidity. Complex and just the slightest savouriness on the finish. Truly delightful rose from a truly f***ed year. 
 
2019 Terre a Terre Piccadilly  |  Adelaide Hills, SA  |  70 bottle 
Pale pink, pretty nose. What more do you need? A blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% chardonnay grown in the Piccadilly valley subregion of Adelaide Hills. High quality, low production rose. 



This is for the G’s 
The imitators of, and close friends to, Riesling

2017 Topper’s Mountain Gewurztraminer | New England, NSW | 75 bottle 
Bone dry barrel fermented Gewurz from one of the coldest wine regions in Australia near Armidale, NSW. Aromatic lychee intertwined with spice and tropical fruit with zippy acidity balancing out the added texture from oak. 

2018 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 130 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak and in bottle, a real thinker’s white. Pioneers here in Canberra and recognized as one of the country’s best GV producers.

2020 Vinden Headcase Blanc  | Hunter Valley, NSW | 75 bottle	
So we’re just a wee bit excited about Vinden wines. A gun young winemaker making super interesting booze from a typically ‘conservative’ wine region. The 2020 blanc is anyone’s guess for what’s in it, but its textural, aromatic, dry and just really really good wine. One for the ‘skins’ and ‘natural wines’ crowd.

2020 Hahndorf Hill Gru  Gruner Veltliner | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Citrus, nectarine and spice on the nose; stonefruit and grapefruit on the palate finished by a long mineral finish with a bit of texture. 

Worthy & worldly Whites
2014 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. You’d have no idea its 7-years old, still as fresh as tomorrow. 

2020 Ravensworth The Long Way Around  Bianco | Swan Valley, WA | 70 bottle 
Twas a vintage to forget for CBR so Bryan looked far afield, and I mean faaaaarr afield to find some grapes to make good booze from. This Trebbiano, Gewurz and Riesling blend from Swan Valley and Great Southern WA is textural, aromatic, grippy and quirky like the man himself. Skins and stoneware ferment.

2015 L.A.S Vino CBDB  | Margaret River, WA | 120 bottle 
100% chenin blanc from Margaret River is given the full treatment; wild yeast ferment, French barriques and clay amphora, lees stirring. The result is a textured, layered wine with a tonne of character and integrated fruit from grapefruit to lime and passionfruit. Awesome. 

2018 Kosciuszko Wines Chardonnay | Tumbarumba, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass
A rich and generous chardy from a smaller producer. No, not the beer company. From the excelsior Peak vineyard in the heart of the Tumbarumba region, its showing generosity of fruit and fine texture. Maybe that’s why Jancis Robinson gave it 18/20. 

2017 Fighting Gully Road Chardonnay | Beechworth, Vic | 90 bottle  
A generous chardonnay from a top vineyard from one of Australia’s top regions from one of Australia’s best wine makers Adrian Rodda. Winning so far? Wait till you drink it; an abundance of character thanks to wild ferment in French oak, a powerful balance between stonefruit and citrus characters and a super clean finish. Awesome Chardy.  
A Concise list of Reds
Listed lightest to heaviest, kinda

2018 Long Rail Gully FMG Gamay | Murrumbateman, CBR | 80 bottle 
Perfumed nose, light palate, silky mouthfeel and just a hint of spice. A very approachable gamay with minimal funk or fuss, clean and balanced. Great with pappardelle. 

2016 Boovability Pinot Noir | Adelaide Hills, SA | 70 bottle | 17 glass 
A super light red; bright fresh sweet cherry fruit on the front palate, savoury mid palate, good length and a twist of spice on the finish. Beautifully smashable cool climate Pinot from Adelaide Hills.  

2019 Pooley Cooinda Vale  Pinot Noir | Coal River Valley, TAS | 140 bottle 
Magical pinot. Delicate and juicy at the same time, soft and structured, supple and bright. Red cherry and raspberry, a little savoury and a lengthy finish. Allow 30 minutes in a decanter to kick it in to gear though.


2019 Intrepido Spanna in the Works  Nebbiolo | Pyrenees, Vic | 75 bottle 
Delightful, youthful light dry red. Really pretty nose of red fruit and pepper. Great grip through the mid palate. Light as a pinot, as dry as a shiraz. Silky.

2018 Hahndorf Hill Blueblood  Blaufranckisch | Adelaide Hills, SA | 90 bottle
‘Pinot with stubble’. Copious blue fruits and cherry on the palate with a distinct spice element. Australians doing Austrian stuff very, very well. 

2019 A Los Vinateros Bravos Pipeno Tinto | Itata Hills, Chile | 80 bottle | 16 glass   
An old bush vine Cinsault form the Itata Hills just south of Santiago. Unfined, unfiltered, unirrigated. Low intervention, low fuss funky red. A bit of a carbonic whiff to it but a delicious lightness on the palate, dried red fruit, spice and sansho pepper. 1000ml bottle. 

2019 Ministry of Clouds Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 80 bottle 
A 98-yr old bush vine vineyard in Blewitt Springs. So it’s good. Good fruit weight, richer style with hints of spice through the palate. Really well made. Good structure and acidity. Perfectly hitting that medium bodied red pitch. 

2016 Dawning Day Merlot Noir  Merlot  | Southern Highlands, NSW | 70 bottle 
Naming indicates a merlot made as light as a Merlot can be; straddling dark cherry and blood plum on the palate, juicy and dry. Enough generosity to keep real Merlot drinkers interested without that stewed fruit character. 


2017 Mount Mary Quintet  Cabernet Blend | Yarra Valley, Vic | 220 bottle
A flagship Aussie Cabernet blend; violet and red fruits on the nose, elegant bright palate. Due to live another 30+ years so best give us a heads up early so we can decant it for a solid hour before drinking. 

2011 Hans Herzog Zweigelt | Marlborough, NZ | 165 bottle 
Blackberry and currant on the strong deep nose, rich earthy tones. Silky mouthfeel with generous plum, cherry and choc. Defined tannins and acidity. A cracking, deep red from one of NZ’s pioneers. Unfined unfiltered. Magic. 


Rizla does Razla
Canberra Shiraz is more than just Clonakilla and Nick O’Leary, as great as they are

2017 Sholto Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 70 bottle | 17 glass
A very pretty and light expression of CBR Razla. Red fruit, spice and Sichuan on the nose with a slight smoked meat  character.  Delectable soft fruit and fine tannin on the palate. Really enjoyable light dry red. 

2017 Long Rail Gully Shiraz | Murrumbateman, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Red berries, spice and liquorice on the nose, light and juicy on the palate; red fruit turning to dark cherry and blood plum through the palate. Allrounder. 

2014 Eden Road 94 Block  Syrah | Murrumbateman, CBR | 90 bottle 
Shiraz exclusively from the Eden Road home block a few clicks south of Murrumbateman. Pristine quality fruit, all red and blue, light Sichuan pepper through the palate. Fine french oak is evident. Phenomenal length and finish. 

2019 Ravensworth Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 115 bottle 
In one word? Super. Super floral and brambly nose. Super red fruit and white pepper on the palate. Super use of fine European oak equals super fine tannins and a super finish. Like I said, just super. 

2019 McKellar Ridge Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 85 bottle 
A spritely, youthful and fine SV from John and Marina. Will develop over the years but perfectly ready now; tight acid, perfumed nose and high quality fruit. Benefits from 30mins in a decanter. 

2016 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 260 bottle 
The Ron Burgundy of Canberra reds; it’s kind of a big deal. Great vintage of a super wine; elegant, perfumed, precise, medium-bodied. Simply a great wine and a main reason behind Clonakilla being the flagship of Murrumbateman. 

2016 Grove Estate Shiraz Viognier | Hilltops, NSW | 75 bottle | 18 glass
A bargain SV from near Young NSW. Perfumed nose as is to be expected, medium weighted fruit, well balanced between the light perfume and dense red fruit characters. Has benefited and softened from a few years in bottle. 

2016 Lark Hill Scuro  Sangiovese + Shiraz | Murrumbateman, CBR | 130 bottle 
A blend of Sangiovese and Shiraz grown on Lark Hill’s Dark Horse Vineyard  at murrumbateman. Rich, intense, dark and generous. Still that lovely CBR shiraz perfume but some power and weight to it. 

2018 Te Mata Bullnose  Syrah | Hawke’s Bay, NZ | 140 bottle 
An Iconic Syrah from a single vineyard in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand. Perfume and spice on the nose, richly blue + red fruits galore, and a fine silky finish. 

2019 Mount Majura Lime Kiln Red | Majura, CBR | 70 bottle | 17 glass
A blend of estate grown Shiraz and Touriga. Choc, coffee and cherry on the nose. Medium palate weight with straight up spices and pepper on the front palate followed by red fruit and a silky finish. 

2014 Penley Estate Scottsburn  Cab + Shiraz | Coonawarra, SA | 85 bottle | 21 glass 
Reward yourself with a cracking example of Australia’s signature heavy red blend. Cabernet dominates the earthy nose, leading to a juicy dark palate – plum, dark cherry, dark choc – and finishing long and dry. 



Dessert style Rieslings 
From beautifully light, to thick and rich, sweet style Rieslings can do anything! Listed here from least to most residual sugar.

2019 Lark Hill Ley-Line  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 65 bottle | 16 glass

2020 Frogmore Creek Iced Riesling  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish. 

2017 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 150 bottle
Dense and concentrated. Raisin and crispy citrus on the nose give way to stonefruit and white cherry on the palate. Incredible booze. Still has a zippy acid backbone underneath all that fleshy goodness.
