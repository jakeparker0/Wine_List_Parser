We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some forgotten relatives of Riesling, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

An off-dry style; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from an excellent producer.

Lively citrus palate, deeper texture and body than most CBR Rieslings. Zippy acidity makes for a great finish. Perfect for medium white protein dishes.

2019 Lark Hill Canberra Region  | 55 bottle | 13 glass
Floral nose, zesty citrus on the palate. Bright and delicious. Mostly from the Freeman vineyard at Young, thus the ‘region’ and not ‘district’ tagline (but made at Bungendore). 

2019 Mount Majura | 65 bottle 
Juicy lemon palate with a long steely finish. Superbly balanced and quintessentially Canberran.  


The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

Pinot+Chard method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2011 Lark Hill Chardonnay Pinot Noir | Bungendore, Canberra District | 110 bottle 
Probably the best vintage sparkling from mainland Aus, in our humble opinion. Be one of the lucky ones to get it before it’s all gone.

Ravensworth Ancestral  Riesling | Murrumbateman, Canberra District | 60 bottle 
Crisp green apple, sherbet lemon drops. Lightly sparkling pet nat, perfect with food. 

NV Jacquesson Cuvee 741  | Champagne, France | 165 bottle | 30 glass

Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2019 Grosset Polish Hill  | Clare Valley, SA | 230 magnum 
THE definitive Clare; bone dry, intense citrus and cool slate with a persistent finish. Everything tastes better from a magnum. 

2018 Mount Horrocks Watervale  | Clare Valley, SA | 70 bottle
Kaffir lime, apple and lemon on the palate. Another precise example from the Clare. 

2018 Koerner Watervale  | Clare Valley, SA | 75 bottle 
Yes there’s classic Clare lemon/lime and slate, but the story here is the immense texture; unfiltered, unfined, hazy pale colour. Good stuff, hot producer. 

2019 Vinteloper | Clare Valley, SA | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Subtle nose of Slate and lemon juice. Floral mid palate and a dry finish creating an irresistible salavating effect. Winner.

2019 Ashton Hills Estate   | Adelaide Hills, SA | 80 bottle 
Clean zesty example from one of the Hills’ finest producers. Plenty of lemon juice and floral notes.

2018 Colmar Block 6  | Orange, NSW | 65 bottle

2012 Crawford River | Crawford River, Vic | 165 bottle 
Still a youthful green, a very delicate Riesling with soft floral and melon on the palate. Acidity has softened but still carries a great wine.

Complex aged nose of citrus, and autumn fruits with a long graceful finish.

2018 Frankland River Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 75 bottle

Beautiful old girls
Aged Rieslings; a ‘gift that keeps on giving,’ as cousin Eddie would say..

2012 Nick O’leary back-vintage  | Canberra District | 80 bottle
Time hasn’t changed the way I feel about this one. A cracker year, great producer, classic Canberra Rizla with citrus and now an added complexity from age.

Complex aged nose of citrus, and autumn fruits with a long finish. Graceful.

Light and spritzy tropical fruit on the palate, a truly top tier ‘grand cru’ German. A persistent and delicate, pretty Riesling. Simply delicious.

Complex, with early signs of ageing yet very light and clean palate. 

2013 Willm Cuvee Emile  | Alsace, France | 90 bottle | 18 glass

Worthy & worldly Whites

2012 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 75 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. 

2018 Vinden Estate Verdelho | Hunter Valley, NSW | 50 bottle | 12 glass 	
Ripe tropical fruit, medium-bodied, tight acidity. None of that chalky texture that plagues this Portuguese workhorse.
