We’re all about the Riesling. 

Yes, we’ve got other phenomenal drops as well; some Riesling impersonators, some other whites that we rate, some fun bubbles (of course), and a short list of seriously good reds. But for us it’s a celebration of the ‘queen of grapes’ and her ability to go with any cuisine.  

Canberra Riesling has come a long way in the (inter)national psyche in the past decade, and we’re fortunate to work with some legend producers and bring you their hard work at great value with minimal faffery. 

Wine is to be drunk and enjoyed. Don’t overcomplicate it. Our list is what we enjoy now, so drink up and enjoy life!


Cheers,
Andy Day

Canberra Riesling 
50-odd producers, 70-odd Rieslings in a vintage. This is just a rotating list highlights

2019 Long Rail Gully | Murrumbateman | 60 bottle | 15 Glass
A light and aromatic style, with dried mandarin on the nose and fresh lime juice on the palate. An enduring clean finish. Very good.

2019 Lake George Winery Ryder  | 65 bottle | 16 glass
P O W E R. Super intense lime juice palate with searing acidity. One for the hardened fans of dry Riesling, and definitely has the bones to age well. 

2019 Sapling Yard Bungendore  | Bungendore | 65 bottle 
Lush floral nose followed by racy acidity and effervescence on the front palate. Good balance and tight minerality. Good long finish. Winemaker Carla Rodeghiero is also vigneron, picker and delivery driver – a one-woman show!

2017 Nick O’Leary White Rocks  | Lake George | 90 bottle
This will be spoken about in revered tones in years to come; a brilliant wine showing the intensity and balance of great Canberra Rieslings. Taken from the Lake George Winery site on the edge of Lake George. 

2019 Gallagher | Jeir | 65 bottle 
Bright lemon curd on the nose, followed by mandarin, honey, and the distinct Canberra minerality palate. Superbly balanced, with a delicate long finish. Clapping emoji.

2019 Helm Classic  | Murrumbateman | 80 bottle 
Classic for a reason. Crisp lime and lemon juice aromas, Canberra minerality. Dry as could be. Perfect young, definitely ageable, good value. 

2011 Eden Road | Murrumbateman | 125 bottle 
Rich oily nose to the fore, bright acid and lime cordial on the front palate, dry texture. Great wine, got the structure and life of fruit to live another 5 years. 

2006 Helm Premium Museum Release | Murrumbateman | 200 bottle 
Power and precision, exotic spice, layers of citrus and pear and a steely minerality. Incredible wine, only a few bottles left on the planet. 

2016 Ravensworth back-vintage | Murrumbateman | 100 bottle 
Lively lemon and fennel on the nose, bright and steely on the front palate. Starting to show some age but this will live for another 15 years plus. 

2017 Clonakilla back-vintage | Murrumbateman | 90 bottle 
Right on the tipping point between tight acidic nose and bold rich agey-ness with just a tickle of kaffir lime. Power and precision, like all Clonakilla wines. Buckets of lime, super tight acidity and it just keeps going and going…

2019 Sholto | Murrumbateman | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Rich floral nose, with a sweetness taken back by clean acidity and tight texture. Orange, pear and mandarin on the palate. Dry finish. Super quirky and different for CBR Riesling and highly enjoyable. 

2019 Helm Half Dry  | Murrumbateman | 55 bottle | 14 glass
‘Halbtrocken’ as the great man calls it; lemon, mandarin, honey, spice and lightly sweet. Phenomenal value bet from the local legend.
Aussie Riesling
Some absolute winners from interstate 

2019 Grosset Polish Hill  | Clare Valley, SA | 230 magnum 
THE definitive Clare; bone dry, intense citrus and cool slate with a persistent finish. Everything tastes better from a magnum. 

2018 Rieslingfreak No. 8 Schatzkammer  | Clare Valley, SA | 80 bottle 
Forget what you think you thought you knew about Clare Riesling and best pretend you’re drinking a German kabinett instead! Delicious, delicate, finely balanced sugar and acid. Lively as hell. 6%ABV. An absolute knockout wine.

2017 Loosen-Barry Wolta Wolta  | Clare Valley, SA | 180 bottle 
A marriage of ‘royal’ families; the Barry’s from Clare and the Loosen’s from Mosel in Germany. The result? A spectacular example of Clare Riesling. Ripe lime and white nectarine on the nose and palate, fine texture and complex. 

2020 Sons of Eden Freya  | Eden Valley, SA | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Light and clean on the nose, a flush of crisp citrus blossom and lemon juice on the palate. A hint of savouriness and a long bouncy finish. A cracker. 

2010 Pizzini Museum Release | King Valley, Vic | 80 bottle | 20 glass
Rich citrus oils and grapefruit zest on the nose. Steely acidity with an ensemble of warm tangerine and orange marmalade characters. A tingle of acidity right to the end. Belter of an aged Riesling. 

2012 Crawford River | Henty, Vic | 185 bottle 
Mainland Australia’s foremost Riesling producer. Supreme ageability from super their site planted in the 1970’s in Henty. Still a youthful green, very delicate with soft floral notes on the nose, apple skins and a hint of white peach on the palate. Acidity has barely softened and this wine still has a good two decades left to live. 

2020 Poppelvej ØST | Adelaide Hills, SA | 85 bottle
Cloudy pear juice to the eye, bursting with crispy dry lemon juice and chamomile on the nose and palate. Grippy from 3 weeks on skins. An undertone of caramel. Complex and delicious in moderation. 

2009 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge  | Frankland River, WA | 160 bottle 
Totally deserving of its reputation as one of Australia’s finest sites for Riesling. Still incredibly fresh with deceptive acid levels lurking behind the lemon curd and fresh lemon pith palate. A beaut. 

2018 Kate Hill | Derwent & Coal River Valleys, Tas | 80 bottle 
Deliciously spicy light citrus nose, with a full mouthfeel. Supremely well balanced. Tassie wines, so hot right now, Tassie wines…

2018 Stargazer Palisander Vineyard  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 100 bottle 
Steely nose, fresh light citrus, followed by a perfectly balanced palate; not overly dry or sweet. A melody of citrus from lime juice to fresh orange oil. 
2019 Printhie Topography  | Orange, NSW | 70 bottle 
Dry and floral, with notes of stonefruit mingled with the citrus splash of aussie Rizla. Plucked from a high altitude site with a northern aspect on the slopes of Mt Canobolas near Orange, NSW. Ripe yet dry. 

International Rieslings
The old world gets pretty worked up about who ‘owns’ Riesling. The Germans, the Austrians, the French. For us: who cares? Just drink the stuff. 

2019 Donnhoff | Nahe, Germany | 75 bottle | 17 glass
Soft and rounded nose, slightly floral, slightly sweet, with tropical fruit and pear on the palate. Light spritz. Great value German off-dry Rizla.

2017 A Christmann Reiterpfad-Hofstuck  GG | Pfalz, Germany | 250 bottle 
Spice, herb and tropical fruit on the nose, then hitting the lemon curd/apple spectrum that’s a bit more familiar to an Aussie palate. Powerful, and an intense long finish. 

2019 Huesgen & Margan Trabener Wurzgarten  | Mosel, Germany | 110 bottle
A collab between Ado Huesgen & Andrew Margan (Hunter Valley, NSW). A super dry Riesling from Mosel; made as if it were a young Hunter Semillon – funny that – with crystalline acidity and tropical fruit. 

2018 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett | Mosel, Germany | 175 bottle
Deep white fruit, quince and packed to the brim with blossom on the nose with distinct slateyness and the typical kabinett pang of sugar and acidity. Elegant as all Prums, and ageing gracefully. 

2008 Brundlmeyer Heiligenstein Lyra  | Kamptal, Austria | 210 bottle 
Intense aromas right through a spectrum of citrus to stonefruit. Light floral and spice notes, building layers of complexity. Very long mineral finish. 

2013 FX Pichler Loibenberg Smaragd  | Wachau, Austria | 160 bottle 
Floral nose with just a slight smokiness to it. From a warmer site and thus a slightly richer Riesling than is typical from Wachau. Lemon and grapefruit on the palate, creamy palate and sustained complex finish. 

2018 Domaine Mersiol | Alsace, France | 85 bottle | 22 glass
Beautifully ripe grapefruit and light citrus nose with a whiff of honey and floral notes. Well-balanced palate; a little rich, a little dry, and tight acidity.  

2018 Domaine Kirrenbourg Granitique | Alsace, Fra | 115 bottle
Zesty lemon on the nose and straw yellow in the glass. Plenty more citrus on the palate; lemon and grapefruit and hints of green apple. Dry, clean and a slight savoury hint. 

2018 Domaine Ostertag Les Jardins | Alsace, France | 260 magnum
White flowers, peach and vine-blossom aromas, followed by a rounded texture and a fine and long acidity. A slight saline character in the finish. Graceful Alsace. Biodynamic producer. 

2016 Domaine Weinbach Cuvee Colette | Alsace, France | 230 bottle
Racy, dry and spicy. Super dry for Alsace. Mixed citrus and white pepper notes. Super old vines, mainly from the famed Schlossberg vineyard but missing the Grand Cru classification. One of the French greats. 

2014 Tunkalilla | Oregon, USA | 85 bottle 
Aussie legend Brian Croser makes brilliant Riesling from a small patch in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. 2014 was a warmer year, and this is a ripe Riesling with tropical fruit on the nose, citrus on the palate and a racy acidity.


The Fizz
Good before, good during, good after

NV Gallagher Duet  | Jeir, Canberra District | 55 bottle | 14 glass
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay method traditionelle with citrus, pear and a light toastiness from time with yeast. Great local bubbles.

2017 Wallaroo Sparkling Riesling | Hall, CBR | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Mouthfillng fizz, refreshing lemon on the palate with acid and sugar in great balance. Long finish with great texture. Highly enjoyable. 

2019 Mada Sui Generis  Pet Nat | Hilltops, NSW | 70 bottle
Fun funky bubbles from near Young NSW. Predominantly Nebbiolo grapes but a splash of Riesling and Chardonnay to add a bit of complexity and interest. Deep amber colour, grippy and textural, strawberries and peach on the palate. 

NV Swift Rose Brut  | Orange, NSW | 85 bottle
Made from select bunches of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir up high on the slopes of Mount Canobolas by Drew Tuckwell. Copper salmon in colour, a fine bead, dry and savoury with a kiss of strawberry and musk on the palate. Richness from 5 years on lees. 

NV Louis Roederer Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 170 bottle
The epitome of straight-down-the-middle non vintage champagne; bright citrus and blossom, super fine bead, acidity balanced by supple yeast making for a toasty long finish. Practically sells itself. 

NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Reserve  | Champagne, Fra | 360 magnum 
Iconic. Crisp clean house style, a cacophony of peach and nectarine on the nose, a super fine mousse with tight acidity and great length. One of the great food pairing champagnes. Made better only by the gratuitous size of the bottle. 


Rose 
Pretty, pretty dry, and pretty good with arvo sunshine

2020 Freeman Rondo Rondinella Rose | Hilltops, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass
Very pretty aromatic nose of nectarine and currants. Red currants and berries on the palate, dry with a tight but not overbearing acidity. Complex and just the slightest savouriness on the finish. Truly delightful rose from a truly f***ed year. 
 
2019 Commanderie de Preissan | Pays D’oc, Fra | 75 bottle
Salmon pink, and a classic dry style southern French rose. Strawberries and cream and redcurrants on the nose and palate, a little more complex than your average provence style but still refreshing and quaffable. 



This is for the G’s 
The imitators of, and close friends to, Riesling

2017 Topper’s Mountain Gewurztraminer | New England, NSW | 75 bottle 
Bone dry barrel fermented Gewurz from one of the coldest wine regions in Australia near Armidale, NSW. Aromatic lychee intertwined with spice and tropical fruit with zippy acidity balancing out the added texture from oak. 

2018 Lark Hill Gruner Veltliner | Bungendore, Canberra District | 130 bottle
Dry Melon, white pepper and complexity from time in oak and in bottle, a real thinker’s white. Pioneers here in Canberra and recognized as one of the country’s best GV producers.

2020 Vinden Headcase Blanc  | Hunter Valley, NSW | 75 bottle	
So we’re just a wee bit excited about Vinden wines. A gun young winemaker making super interesting booze from a typically ‘conservative’ wine region. The 2020 blanc is anyone’s guess for what’s in it, but its textural, aromatic, dry and just really really good wine. One for the ‘skins’ and ‘natural wines’ crowd.

2020 Hahndorf Hill Gru  Gruner Veltliner | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Citrus, nectarine and spice on the nose; stonefruit and grapefruit on the palate finished by a long mineral finish with a bit of texture. 

Worthy & worldly Whites
2013 Dogpoint Section 94 Sauvignon Blanc | Marlborough, NZ | 85 bottle
A Marlborough savvy in a Riesling shrine? Totally blasphemous, but totally deserving of it’s place - as good as an SB can get. Pristine gooseberry and herb notes. You’d have no idea its 7-years old, still as fresh as tomorrow. 

2020 Ravensworth The Long Way Around  Bianco | Swan Valley, WA | 70 bottle 
Twas a vintage to forget for CBR so Bryan looked far afield, and I mean faaaaarr afield to find some grapes to make good booze from. This Trebbiano, Gewurz and Riesling blend from Swan Valley and Great Southern WA is textural, aromatic, grippy and quirky like the man himself. Skins and stoneware ferment.

2015 L.A.S Vino CBDB  | Margaret River, WA | 120 bottle 
100% chenin blanc from Margaret River is given the full treatment; wild yeast ferment, French barriques and clay amphora, lees stirring. The result is a textured, layered wine with a tonne of character and integrated fruit from grapefruit to lime and passionfruit. Awesome. 

2018 Kosciuszko Wines Chardonnay | Tumbarumba, NSW | 70 bottle | 17 glass
A rich and generous chardy from a smaller producer. No, not the beer company. From the excelsior Peak vineyard in the heart of the Tumbarumba region, its showing generosity of fruit and fine texture. Maybe that’s why Jancis Robinson gave it 18/20. 

2016 Fighting Gully Road Chardonnay | Beechworth, Vic | 90 bottle  
A generous chardonnay from a top vineyard from one of Australia’s top regions from one of Australia’s best wine makers Adrian Rodda. Winning so far? Wait till you drink it; an abundance of character thanks to wild ferment in French oak, a powerful balance between stonefruit and citrus characters and a super clean finish. Awesome Chardy.  
A Concise list of Reds
Listed lightest to heaviest, kinda

2016 Boovability Pinot Noir | Adelaide Hills, SA | 65 bottle | 16 glass 
A super light red; bright fresh sweet cherry fruit on the front palate, savoury mid palate, good length and a twist of spice on the finish. Beautifully smashable cool climate Pinot from Adelaide Hills.  
2019 Pooley Cooinda Vale  Pinot Noir | Coal River Valley, TAS | 140 bottle 
Magical pinot. Delicate and juicy at the same time, soft and structured, supple and bright. Red cherry and raspberry, a little savoury and a lengthy finish. Allow 30 minutes in a decanter to kick it in to gear though.

2019 Intrepido Spanna in the Works  Nebbiolo | Pyrenees, Vic | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Delightful, youthful light dry red. Really pretty nose of red fruit and pepper. Great grip through the mid palate. We’re sick of the saying ‘a really good food wine’, but if the shoe fits…

2019 A Los Vinateros Bravos Pipeno Tinto | Itata Hills, Chile | 80 bottle | 16 glass   
An old bush vine Cinsault form the Itata Hills just south of Santiago. Unfined, unfiltered, unirrigated. Low intervention, low fuss funky red. A bit of a carbonic whiff to it but a delicious lightness on the palate, dried red fruit, spice and sansho pepper. 1000ml bottle. 

2018 Mount Majura Lime Kiln Red  | Majura, CBR | 70 bottle 
A blend of estate grown Shiraz and Touriga. Choc, coffee and cherry on the nose. Medium palate weight with straight up spices and pepper on the front palate followed by red fruit and a silky finish. 

2019 Vanguardist Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 125 bottle
Graceful Grenache from the ‘silver sands’ vineyard at Blewitt Springs. Lots of concentrated red berry character and defined structure. Really good wine.  

2018 Ministry of Clouds Grenache | McLaren Vale, SA | 80 bottle 
A 98-yr old bush vine vineyard in Blewitt Springs. So it’s good. Good fruit weight, richer style with hints of spice through the palate. Really well made. Good structure and acidity. Perfectly hitting that medium bodied red pitch. 

2014 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier | Murrumbateman, CBR | 250 bottle 
The Ron Burgundy of Canberra reds; it’s kind of a big deal. Great vintage of a super wine; elegant, perfumed, precise, medium-bodied. Simply a great wine and a main reason behind Clonakilla being the flagship of Murrumbateman. 

2018 Te Mata Bullnose  Syrah | Hawke’s Bay, NZ | 140 bottle 
An Iconic single vineyard Syrah from Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand. Perfumed and spice on the nose, richly blue and red fruits galore, and a fine silky finish. 

2016 Penley Estate 11 Barrels  Shiraz | Coonawarra, SA | 100 bottle | 25 glass
Reward yourself with a cracking Shiraz from Cabernet country. That classic terra rossa character with medium weight red and blue fruit. I’m super chuffed with this wine so I bought the entire ACT allocation. 

2011 Hans Herzog Zweigelt | Marlborough, NZ | 165 bottle 
Blackberry and currant on the strong deep nose, rich earthy tones. Silky mouthfeel with generous plum, cherry and choc. Defined tannins and acidity. A cracking, deep red from one of NZ’s pioneers. Unfined unfiltered. Magic. 



Dessert style Rieslings 
From beautifully light, to thick and rich, sweet style Rieslings can do anything! Listed here from least to most residual sugar.

2019 Lark Hill Ley-Line  | Bungendore, Canberra District | 65 bottle | 16 glass
Pale yellow, medium-bodied sticky with zingy acidity and beautiful ripe pineapple palate.

2019 Frogmore Creek Iced Riesling  | Coal River Valley, Tas | 60 bottle | 15 glass
Delicate quince, honey and apricot aromas and palate. Perfect with fruit desserts or soft cheeses. 

2016 Dr. Loosen Eiswein  | Mosel, Germany | 200 bottle
The real deal; vibrant and racy wine produced from Riesling grapes frozen solid on the vine and picked in the early hours and pressed while still frozen. Juicy and sweet with a crisp acid finish. 

2017 JJ Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr  Auslese | Mosel, Germany | 150 bottle
Dense and concentrated. Raisin and crispy citrus on the nose give way to stonefruit and white cherry on the palate. Incredible booze. Still has a zippy acid backbone underneath all that fleshy goodness.
